A1. Appendix II.

<P>
SOME STORIES THAT I REMEMBER

</H3>
<HR>


<P>


<P>
This Appendix includes several stories that, if sufficiently urged, I would
probably have told (or retold) you if I had had the opportunity. I shall
make them as brief as possible, merely giving you the general outline, and
leaving it to your imagination to fill in such local color and other details
as you may deem appropriate. In each case the source of the story will be
stated.
