17. OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THE TORPEDO DEPOT

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
This Depot was responsible for the design, procurement and supply of all
Submarine Mine equipment and supplies to the Submarine Mine Service (which,
as I remember it, consisted then of about 150 Companies). I held this dual
assignment for two years. During this time I devoted my time until noon to
my Mine Company, and the time from then until midnight to my Torpedo Depot
work. It was necessary for me to visit a number of factories to inspect mine
materiel under manufacture, and, under the provisions of the law it was possible
for me to do this only by taking leave of absence and by paying my own traveling
expenses -- which I gladly did in order to gain the experience.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During the time I commanded a Company at <A NAME="Totten.33" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A>, Captain P. P. <A NAME="Bishop.33" HREF="index.html#Bishop">Bishop</A> (who
had recently been married to <A NAME="Grace.34" HREF="index.html#Grace">Grace</A> <A NAME="Calvert.34" HREF="index.html#Calvert">Calvert</A>, of <A NAME="Portland.34" HREF="index.html#Portland">Portland</A>, <A NAME="Maine.34" HREF="index.html#Maine">Maine</A>) also commended
a Company there. He and I regularly walked twelve or fifteen miles each Sunday.
Once a week the three of us would go to <A NAME="New York.36" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> for dinner and a show. He
and I alternated as host, and the host was supposed to select a place to
dine that we had never previously dined at, and not to order any main dishes
that we had ever had before.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon completion of my two years' tour of duty with the 135th Company (my
first command, and the one I enjoyed most) I was relieved from assignment
thereto, and for the next three years I devoted full time to the Torpedo
Depot. (I might inject here that the word Torpedo, in the title, was derived
from the fact that, under the Engineers, who had charge of all submarine
mine work until about 1904, when this was transferred to the Coast Artillery,
submarine mines were known as torpedos).

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Among the projects that came up while I was in charge of the Torpedo Depot
I recall the following:

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(1). Redesign. The redesign of practically all submarine equipment, including
power panels, operating boards, mine transformers, mine cases, mine planter
equipment (davits, catheads, snatch blocks, grapnels, etc.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(2). Specifications. Practically no specifications had ever been prepared
at the Depot for the numerous items of tools, paints and oils, for mine cases,
planting equipment, power panels, operating boards, transformers, casemate
generator, storage batteries and other casemate equipment. Such specifications,
based upon a study of Navy, Army and other standard specifications, where
applicable, and upon many conferences with the manufacturers concerned, were
prepared.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(3). 19 conductor cable. While I was on duty in the Chief's office I discovered
that most of the 19 conductor cable supplied to the <A NAME="Philippines.70" HREF="index.html#Philippines">Philippines</A> for the mine
project in <A NAME="Manila.71" HREF="index.html#Manila">Manila</A> Bay had, within two years, become unserviceable. I began
a study of the design of submarine cable which continued during the five
years I remained at the Depot, and which involved my spending much time in
practically every factory in the country making such cables. I went to <A NAME="Washington.74" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>
and enlisted the cooperation of Dr. <A NAME="Stratton.75" HREF="index.html#Stratton">Stratton</A>, Chief of the Bureau of Standards,
in determining the cause of the deterioration of the 19 conductor cable in
the <A NAME="Philippines.77" HREF="index.html#Philippines">Philippines</A>. We had two reels shipped back to this country, one of which
was sent to the Bureau of Standards and the other to the cable manufacturer
(The Safety Insulated Wire and Cable Company, <A NAME="Bayonne.79" HREF="index.html#Bayonne">Bayonne</A>, N.J.). The cables
were cut in 100 foot lengths and each length was subjected to every chemical,
physical and electrical test we could devise. They were illuminating. They
indicated that the deterioration of the rubber compound had been due to two
causes: to the solvent action of the tar (due to the creosote it contained)
with which the jute filler (the bedding between the armor wire and the conductors)
had always been saturated; and to the deformation of the insulation of the
individual conductors due to the radial compression resulting from the application
of the armor wire. Accurate tests made, for the first time, of all the submarine
cable in the service, made it become apparent that, irrespective of climatic
and other local conditions, this cable had undergone a rapid and serious
deterioration throughout the service. Steps were taken, in cooperation with
the Bureau of Standards, to prepare new specifications, in consultation with
the experts of the various cable manufacturers, which would embody all the
lessons learned in the tests and studies made during the previous four years,
and which would be agreed to by all as representing the highest standards
in the manufacture of 19 conductor cable attainable. These new specifications
were issued early in 1917, and a considerable amount of new cable was ordered.


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
It was a great disappointment to all concerned that this cable also deteriorated
in storage. It became apparent that, in spite of all the precautions taken
to minimize the distortion of the conductor insulation (jute spirals had
been laid in the interstices between adjacent conductors to fill up this
space) it was not practicable to make a 19 conductor cable with only 1/16
inch of insulation without compressing this insulation at spots to such an
extent as to ground the conductor. Since the thickness of the insulation
could not be increased without increasing the outside diameter of the cable
to such a point as to reduce materially the length of the cable that could
be placed on the maximum sized reel that could be handled on the planter,
I very reluctantly arrived at the conclusion that, due solely to the impracticability
of manufacturing a reliable 19 conductor cable, our mine system, which otherwise
was the most reliable in the world, would have to be completely redeveloped
to permit a group (of 19 mines) to be tested, controlled and fired over one
single conductor cable (which could have sufficiently thick insulation to
make it very durable and reliable), using, in general, the principles and
methods employed in automatic telephony.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(4). Single conductor mine system. Through the cooperation of the Bureau
of Standards, I was able to secure the full and invaluable cooperation of
Dr. <A NAME="Jewett.121" HREF="index.html#Jewett">Jewett</A>, the head of the Western Electric (AT&T) Research Laboratories,
one of the outstanding scientists in the country, in the study of the problems
involved. After some months of intensive study and experimentation, it was
decided that the project was practical, and the equipment for one group was
manufactured and sent to Fort <A NAME="Mills.125" HREF="index.html#Mills">Mills</A> (<A NAME="Corregidor.125" HREF="index.html#Corregidor">Corregidor</A>) for test. (Note. I left
the Depot shortly after this. The development work was carried on by my successors
at the Depot, using, however, equipment secured from another manufacturer,
and the one-wire system replaced entirely the old 19 conductor system. It
was used with remarkable success in World War II.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(5) The Mine Planter <A NAME="Graham.132" HREF="index.html#Graham">Graham</A>. In 1915 the Chief of Coast Artillery considered
it essential that a new mine planter and also a new cable ship be provided
for the Coast Artillery. Funds were available, however, for only one vessel.
The Quartermaster General (who was responsible for the design and purchase
of all ships and boats for the Army) was requested, by the Chief of Coast
Artillery, to design one vessel that would serve as a combined mine planter
and cable ship. The QMG, after considerable discussion, finally stated that
it would not be practicable to design one vessel that would serve both purposes
satisfactorily. The office of the Chief of Coast Artillery (Colonel R. P.
<A NAME="Davis.141" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A>, Executive) bundled all the papers up and sent them to me with instructions
to design a combined mine planter and cable ship. While I had had occasion
to design mine planting equipment for a mine planter, I had never been on
a cable ship, and I knew nothing about ship design.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I spent some months studying the problem, during which time I conferred with
Naval Constructors in the Navy Department and with the various manufacturers
of winches, windlasses and similar equipment and with the officers of the
Signal Corps Cable Ship "<A NAME="Joseph.150" HREF="index.html#Joseph">Joseph</A> <A NAME="Henry.150" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A>" and of the Western Union Cable Ship
"Western Union", both of which I visited and examined in detail.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As I knew nothing about the design of the shape and dimensions of the hull,
I went to the office of the Chief of Coast Artillery, examined the Classification
Cards of all 2nd Lieutenants, and finally found one pertaining to a Lieutenant
K. T. Blood, who had graduated with credit from the Naval Architecture course
at M. I. T. I had him assigned to the Depot as my Assistant. (He later commanded
the Depot and he became a Major General in World War II.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The composite design was effected by doing away with the forepeak used on
all cable ships and employing a Torpedo Boat type windlass, thus leaving
the rails forward and the deck clear for mine work. This vessel, which was
built in 1916, was named the "<A NAME="Graham.165" HREF="index.html#Graham">Graham</A>" and remained in effective use as long
as the submarine mine service existed -- although a number of similar vessels
in which the design had been changed somewhat were put out of service before
that time.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Having gotten into the business of designing boats, we next designed a nonsinkable
24 foot power mine yawl, which replaced the old rowboats previously used
in all mine companies, and later we redesigned the Distribution Box boat
and its equipment. I was amused one day, when I was in the office of the
Quartermaster General, to have a Naval Constructor from the Navy Department
come in and say that the Navy was in a hurry to procure 50 power boats for
harbor work, and that he wanted to get copies of our specifications for power
yawls, as they were exactly what they wanted. I never knew of another instance
of the Navy's using an Army specification for boats for its own use.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(6) Experimental work in the Race. In August and September, 1915, I spent
two months on a Mine Planter, conducting experimental work in the Race (eastern
entrance to Long Island Sound) where the depth was 40 fathoms and the current
at times was 6 knots. This work, which was most interesting, was for the
following purposes:

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(a) To secure data to enable a new automatic anchor to be designed. The then
existing automatic anchor (Model of 1910) weighed but 1350 pounds. It had
proved to be too unreliable in its action to warrant its use. We had, furthermore,
increased the size of the mine cases and the weight of the explosive charge,
and this necessitated the use of an automatic anchor weighing about 3000
pounds.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The experimental work involved the design and use, under the difficult conditions
of current and depth existing in the Race, of delicate laboratory apparatus
designed to secure, during the planting of a large number of mines, and anchors,
accurate data, at every two foot interval in the descent, as to the velocity
of the anchor, the tension on the distance line and the tension on the mooring
rope. These tests showed conclusively that the unreliability of the 1910
anchor resulted from the fact that it tumbled about in its descent, instead
of maintaining a constant vertical axis. They also showed, somewhat to my
surprise, that a 1910 anchor attained a vertical velocity of about 15 feet
per second within the first ten feet of its descent, and that this velocity
remained constant throughout the remainder of its descent, irrespective of
the depth.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The data secured in these tests enabled us to design and procure the 3000
pound, Model 1916 Automatic Anchors in time for them to be used throughout
the service by the beginning of World War I.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(b) To secure accurate data as to the actual submergence of one of the largest
mines when planted in the Race. This data was obtained by designing a continuous-recording
pressure (submergence) gauge that was attached to a No. 50 mine case which
was then planted in 40 fathoms of water. These tests showed conclusively
that this case (the largest then in use), under service conditions in the
Race, would have a depression of not less at any time than 20 feet, and of
from 75 to 120 feet for current velocities of from 3 to 5 1/2 knots. These
tests established the fact that Buoyant Mines could not be used effectively
in the Race or in <A NAME="Admiralty.224" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A> Inlet (entrance to <A NAME="Puget.224" HREF="index.html#Puget">Puget</A> Sound), and led to the
abandonment of the submarine mine defenses of these two localities.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(c). To derive, if possible, an accurate Formula for computing the probable
submergence of a mine under hydrographic conditions similar to those obtaining
in the Race.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The formula deduced by General <A NAME="Abbott.233" HREF="index.html#Abbott">Abbott</A>, one of the most remarkable officers
in Army history (He developed the original submarine mine system in about
1872. His "Professional Papers No. 23, Corps of Engineers" is a military
classic. He also invented the Pressure Gauge, established the first formula
for determining the effects of subaqueous explosions, and first proposed
the use of mortars for coast defense weapons. When over 80 years old he was
appointed by <A NAME="President.239" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> <A NAME="Theodore.239" HREF="index.html#Theodore">Theodore</A> <A NAME="Roosevelt.239" HREF="index.html#Roosevelt">Roosevelt</A> as Chairman of the Board of experts
to decide whether the <A NAME="Panama.240" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> <A NAME="Canal.240" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A> should be a sea level canal or a lock
canal) was based upon the assumption that the current velocity at all depths
is practically the same as at the surface. In our tests simultaneous tests
were taken on three Gurley Current Meters suspended in tandem at different
depths. These tests demonstrated conclusively that this assumption, (or any
other assumption as to a definite relationship between depth and velocity)
and hence any formula based upon it, is necessarily incorrect for localities
like the Race. We observed that, in the Race, a velocity of (say) 3 knots
on the surface in one direction would correspond to a velocity of a quite
different amount in an entirely different direction, at a different depth
below the surface, and that the relationship between the two readings would
differ materially from day to day.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(d). To test the "<A NAME="Leon.254" HREF="index.html#Leon">Leon</A> Mine". (A submergence controllable mine developed
by the Depot, on the basis of patents of Captain Leon, of the <A NAME="Swedish.255" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> Navy.)
to determine its practicability for use at the <A NAME="Pacific.256" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> end of the <A NAME="Panama.256" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A>
<A NAME="Canal.257" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A> and in the Race. These tests demonstrated the impracticability of the
use of such a type mine where the depths and currents were similar to those
existing in the Race.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall one matter, during the time I was at the Depot, which later assumed
some importance. About a year before I became Disbursing Officer, as a result
of extensive tests conducted by the Coast Artillery Board, it had been decided
to adopt TNT (then a newly developed explosive) to replace guncotton as the
explosive for submarine mines. It was not then manufactured in the United
States. However the <A NAME="DuPont.267" HREF="index.html#DuPont">DuPont</A> Company took a contract to make it for the Torpedo
Depot. Upon my arrival I found that no deliveries had as yet been made and
that considerable liquidated damages had, under the contract, accrued against
the Company. They stated that they had had several accidents, involving the
loss of several lives, that they had been unable to develop a safe manufacturing
procedure, and they requested that, on humanitarian grounds, the contract
be cancelled and the liquidated damages be waived. After much correspondence,
I declined to agree to this, and they then appealed to the Secretary of War.
The matter was referred to Gen. <A NAME="Crozier.275" HREF="index.html#Crozier">Crozier</A>, the Chief of Ordnance (Ordnance
Department procedure was followed in Torpedo Depot contracts) and I was ordered
to <A NAME="Washington.277" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> for a conference with him. He was disposed to recommend to
the Secretary of War that action be taken as desired by the <A NAME="DuPont.278" HREF="index.html#DuPont">DuPont</A> Company.
During the considerable period of correspondence between the Company and
myself I had managed to place an order for a considerable amount of TNT with
a <A NAME="German.281" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> manufacturer and this TNT had been received and found, by tests
made in the Ordnance Department Laboratories, to be of the very highest quality.
I took the position that it was essential, in the interests of National Defense,
that TNT be made in this country and that if the Germans were able to make
it safely and cheaply in large quantities the <A NAME="DuPont.285" HREF="index.html#DuPont">DuPont</A> Company should be able
to do so, that it behooved them to develop a satisfactory procedure, and
that they should be held to their contract (although probably at considerable
loss to them). After much discussion Gen. <A NAME="Crozier.288" HREF="index.html#Crozier">Crozier</A> accepted that view. The
DuPont Company strongly resented my "unreasonable" attitude, but they were
forced to make such improvements in their manufacturing procedure as made
it a safe and satisfactory process for the manufacture of TNT in large quantities,
and, after a long delay, they eventually completed their order satisfactorily.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Within about a year World War I broke out. While it was necessary for <A NAME="DuPont.295" HREF="index.html#DuPont">DuPont</A>
to build new plants, by the end of the war these plants were producing over
forty million pounds of TNT per month for the Allies. I have an idea that,
had it not been for my "unreasonable" attitude, this important contribution
to the Allied cause probably could not have been made in time to become fully
effective. However, I never had occasion to discuss this aspect of the matter
with the DuPont Company.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall one experience, during this period, that may interest you on account
of its melodramatic possibilities.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
One day shortly before we entered the war there came into my office a man
of about forty, with heavy black hair, and an olive complexion, expensively
but flashily dressed, with no particular accent. He introduced himself, in
not particularly grammatical English, spoken with no particular accent, as
Mr. J. <A NAME="Muller.312" HREF="index.html#Muller">Muller</A> (I do not now recall the name he actually used, but this will
do) and said he had been referred to me by the office of the Secretary of
War, upon whom he had called to offer, as a contribution to the National
security, plans for a new type submarine mine. He then told me, in some detail,
his history, that he was a <A NAME="Swiss.316" HREF="index.html#Swiss">Swiss</A>; that his family was an old and prominent
one, his father having been <A NAME="President.317" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Swiss Republic; that he had
been a Captain in the Engineers of the Swiss Army, and had, among other things,
been in charge of installing a system of mines in the <A NAME="Simplon.319" HREF="index.html#Simplon">Simplon</A> tunnel to destroy
it if need be in time of war; that he had, for four years, been the Swiss
military attache in <A NAME="Washington.321" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>; that he had later resigned his commission
in the Army, had gone to <A NAME="Mexico.322" HREF="index.html#Mexico">Mexico</A>, had become the trusted advisor of President
<A NAME="Diaz.323" HREF="index.html#Diaz">Diaz</A> and had been in charge of the procurement of all the arms and equipment
for the <A NAME="Mexican.324" HREF="index.html#Mexican">Mexican</A> army; that upon the fall of the Diaz government in 1911 he
had been arrested with several of his associates, had been lined up and ostensibly
shot; that, by intrigue he had escaped being killed, another body having
been substituted for his; that he had finally escaped on a tramp steamer
and had come to the <A NAME="United States.328" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>; and that he had the greatest admiration
for the United States, had become a naturalized citizen, and desired, in
every way possible, to help strengthen the defenses of this country. He showed
me a number of newspaper clippings recounting his capture and execution.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I told him that I would be very glad to examine the plans for his mine, which,
he said, was of the same type as those installed in the <A NAME="Simplon.335" HREF="index.html#Simplon">Simplon</A> tunnel. Some
days later he visited me again, but without the plans, which, he said, were
being made up by a draftsman. He was much interested in the details of our
mine system and he asked me many questions about it. I told him that they
were electrically controlled, but that I regretted that I could not give
him any further details. Eventually he brought out his drawings. The mine
was of a simple type. To my surprise, however, it was controlled by air pressure,
a separate lead pipe being required to connect each mine with the shore.
He said this was the method of control that was used, most satisfactorily,
in the <A NAME="Simplon.344" HREF="index.html#Simplon">Simplon</A> tunnel. It was so obviously a totally impracticable system
for use for submarine mines that I marvelled that a trained Engineer should
seriously propose it. Upon discussing his drawing with him I was puzzled
at his apparent ignorance of some rather elementary principles, but I made
several suggestions as to how I thought his design might be improved. A few
days later he reappeared with new drawings embodying all the suggestions
I had made. I told him definitely that his mine was not adapted to our use.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Several weeks later he returned, told me that he had made a contract with
the <A NAME="German.354" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> Government to supply it with a large number of his mines, that
he was preparing to build a large plant in <A NAME="New Jersey.355" HREF="index.html#New Jersey">New Jersey</A> to manufacture them,
and that he wanted me to resign from the Army and take charge of his plant,
that he expected to make about a million dollars; and that I could name my
own salary and terms. I explained to him that I had been educated at West
Point at government expense, that I had spent many years as an Army officer,
and that, particularly in view of the fact that war had broken out, I could
not consider resigning from the Army on any terms. He urged me at least to
visit his home and look over the plans for his factory. The plans were very
sketchy and obviously had not been prepared by competent engineers. I met
his wife, who was a tall, angular, uncommunicative person, of apparently
a very limited education. They showed me several large family albums, with
pictures of their ancestral palace, and cordially invited me to visit it
if I was ever in <A NAME="Switzerland.367" HREF="index.html#Switzerland">Switzerland</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Later he came to me, said the <A NAME="German.370" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> government was much interested in securing
some of his mines at an early date, and that Captain Boy Ed, the German Military
Attache, (also, as was found out later, the head of the German espionage
and sabotage organization in this country) was anxious to arrange a conference
with him. He urged me to accompany him to a secret meeting place, at night,
in a very disreputable part of <A NAME="New York.375" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> City, in order to meet Boy Ed. I
had no desire or intention of meeting Boy Ed, and I decided that the time
had come to drop Mr. <A NAME="Muller.377" HREF="index.html#Muller">Muller</A> from my list of acquaintances.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
A few months later I learned his real history. There had been a Captain Muller,
who had been and done everything I had been told, with the exception that,
as a matter of fact, he had been killed as had been recounted in the newspaper
clippings I had seen. My Mr. Muller had been his valet and his wife had been
a maid in the house. Upon the death of his master he had assumed his name,
appropriated all his papers and personal effects, and embarked on a career
of -- I have never been sure of what.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
About this time I had another little experience that now comes to mind. I
had had occasion to go to the <A NAME="Babcock.390" HREF="index.html#Babcock">Babcock</A> and <A NAME="Wilcox.390" HREF="index.html#Wilcox">Wilcox</A> Boiler plant at <A NAME="Bayonne.390" HREF="index.html#Bayonne">Bayonne</A>,
<A NAME="New Jersey.391" HREF="index.html#New Jersey">New Jersey</A>, to confer with Mr. J. P. <A NAME="Snedden.391" HREF="index.html#Snedden">Snedden</A>, the General Manager, with reference
to the best method of welding a new design of mine case. I found him to be
a very attractive man and a thoroughly competent engineer. It developed that
he had a son at M. I. T. and he asked me many questions about M. I. T. He
was greatly worried about how much of an allowance he should give his son.
He explained that as a poor boy he had never had any money, that he was all
wrapped up in his son's future, that he was able to give him any reasonable
allowance and that he wished my advice as to what would be best for the son.
He discussed this and other matters on several later trips that I made to
the plant, and we became quite good friends.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
One afternoon he called me on long distance and asked me to join him for
dinner at the Engineer's Club in <A NAME="New York.404" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> that evening, saying that he wished
to discuss with me a matter of urgent importance, which he could not discuss
over the telephone. I joined him and during our dinner (in a private dining
room) he told me what was on his mind. He said that, as a young man, he had
been associated with Mr. <A NAME="Edward.408" HREF="index.html#Edward">Edward</A> R. <A NAME="Stettinius.408" HREF="index.html#Stettinius">Stettinius</A>, a young lawyer, in the management
of the <A NAME="Sterling.409" HREF="index.html#Sterling">Sterling</A> Boiler works, in the midwest; that later Mr. Stettinius had
reorganized the <A NAME="Babcock.410" HREF="index.html#Babcock">Babcock</A> and <A NAME="Wilcox.410" HREF="index.html#Wilcox">Wilcox</A> Boiler Company and had brought him there
to run it; that the two of them had been close friends for many years; that
Mr. Stettinius was then a member of the firm of J. P. <A NAME="Morgan.412" HREF="index.html#Morgan">Morgan</A> and Company,
in Wall Street; that the Allied governments were preparing to place tremendous
orders for guns, ammunition and explosives in the <A NAME="United States.414" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> and had selected
J. P. Morgan & Co. to take charge of all their procurements; that Mr. <A NAME="Stettinius.415" HREF="index.html#Stettinius">Stettinius</A>
had been placed in charge of all this work; that he had agreed to do so provided
he was able to have Mr. <A NAME="Snedden.417" HREF="index.html#Snedden">Snedden</A> as his confidential Engineering advisor;
and, finally, that he wanted me to resign from the Army and become his assistant.
I told him the same thing I had told Mr. <A NAME="Muller.419" HREF="index.html#Muller">Muller</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
This is the only bona fide offer I have ever had to resign and accept a position,
on practically my own terms, in civil life. I have, perhaps, occasionally
wondered a little what might have happened -- or, perhaps what might not
have happened -- if I had become associated, at that time, with the firm
of J. P. <A NAME="Morgan.426" HREF="index.html#Morgan">Morgan</A> & Co. However, I have never regretted my decision.
