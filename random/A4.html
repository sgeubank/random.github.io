A4. SWEDISH SUBMARINE MINES IN WORLD WAR I.
</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During World War I <A NAME="Sweden.20" HREF="index.html#Sweden">Sweden</A> was a neutral country, and <A NAME="Stockholm.20" HREF="index.html#Stockholm">Stockholm</A> became the
largest and most important common center of counterespionage of both the
Allies and of the Germans. At this time our Military Attache in Sweden was
Lieut. N. E. <A NAME="Solbert.23" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A>, Corps of Engineers, (#6 in the class of 1915, U.S.M.A.)
whose father had been a rather prominent man in Sweden before the War, before
coming to the <A NAME="United States.25" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>, and who, himself, had been born in Sweden.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Shortly after the war Lt. Solbert, while in <A NAME="Washington.28" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>, gave a talk to some
of the General Staff officers on duty in the War Department, in which he
told us about some of his problems during the War. I recall two stories that
he told us which I, at the time, thought quite interesting; perhaps you will
think so too.

<HR>
Early in World War I, in the effort to hinder as much as possible the exit
of <A NAME="German.36" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarines from the <A NAME="Baltic.36" HREF="index.html#Baltic">Baltic</A> Sea into the North Sea, the <A NAME="British.36" HREF="index.html#British">British</A>
planted submarine mines across between the shores of <A NAME="Sweden.37" HREF="index.html#Sweden">Sweden</A> and <A NAME="Denmark.37" HREF="index.html#Denmark">Denmark</A>,
excluding the 3 mile zone of each of these neutral countries.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As the war progressed, however, these mines failed almost completely to accomplish
their purpose, the Germans operating around the flanks of the mines, within
the 3 mile zone, and the Allied Attaches in Sweden were informed by the <A NAME="British.43" HREF="index.html#British">British</A>
<A NAME="Admiralty.44" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A> of the seriousness of the situation and were directed to take every
possible step to prevent the exit of the <A NAME="German.45" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarines.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Lt. <A NAME="Solbert.48" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A> went secretly to the Editor of one of the principal <A NAME="Swedish.48" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> papers,
who had been a good friend of his father, and who was personally pro-Ally
in his sentiments, although the paper and the Swedish government were strictly
neutral.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He explained the situation fully and got the Editor to agree to cooperate
in a scheme to at least slow up the passage of the <A NAME="German.55" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarines through
the straits.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<A NAME="Solbert.59" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A> went to the <A NAME="British.59" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> Naval Attache, explained the plan and got him
to request the British <A NAME="Admiralty.60" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A> to send several submarines into the <A NAME="Baltic.60" HREF="index.html#Baltic">Baltic</A>,
passing within the 3 mile zone off the <A NAME="Swedish.61" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> coast, where the water was
so shallow that the submarines could not safely submerge. He arranged that
the passage of these submarines should be observed by one of the reporters
of the paper, and next day the paper came out with headlines describing the
passage of the British submarines within the Swedish 3 mile limit and demanding
that the government take prompt action to stop this brazen violation by the
<A NAME="British.67" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> of Swedish neutrality. Next day this was repeated, and the same demand
for prompt action was repeated. Then the principal papers, including those
that were pro-<A NAME="German.69" HREF="index.html#German">German</A>, joined in this demand and continued to make it.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In a few days the friendly Editor, in and editorial, protested strongly at
the continued inactivity of the government and made the definite suggestion
that the passage of the <A NAME="British.74" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> submarines be be stopped by planting <A NAME="Swedish.74" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A>
mines within the 3 mile zone. This demand was taken up by the other papers,
and the pressure on the government became so great that it acceded to the
demand.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The papers noted with satisfaction that no more British submarines passed
through <A NAME="Swedish.81" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> waters. The <A NAME="British.81" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> <A NAME="Admiralty.81" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A> noted that neither did any
more <A NAME="German.82" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarines do so.
