<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>
When my parents moved to Ft. <A NAME="Smith.19" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> I was about five years old. My brother <A NAME="Dan.19" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A>
had been born about a year before we left <A NAME="Oxford.20" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>, and my brother <A NAME="Drew.20" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A> was
born in Ft. Smith in 1889. Our boyhood was typical of that in a family of
three normal boys, brought up in a happy family living simply within its
means but possessed of many firm and long time friends. Among these I remember
particularly Mr. J. <A NAME="Adair.24" HREF="index.html#Adair">Adair</A> <A NAME="Skipwith.24" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>, Mr. J. B. <A NAME="McDonough.24" HREF="index.html#McDonough">McDonough</A>, and Gen. H. B. <A NAME="Armistead.24" HREF="index.html#Armistead">Armistead</A>.
Skipwith, who was about father's age, had attended the University of <A NAME="Mississippi.25" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A>
at the same time as father and was, at that time, one of the largest cotton
buyers in that part of the country. McDonough was a young lawyer who later
became one of the most prominent lawyers in the State. Gen. Armistead, a
V.M.I. graduate, was a relative of the Gen. Armistead who was killed in <A NAME="Pickett.29" HREF="index.html#Pickett">Pickett</A>'s
charge at <A NAME="Gettysburg.30" HREF="index.html#Gettysburg">Gettysburg</A>. Skipwith and McDonough occupied a room in our house
for many years, and <A NAME="Skipwith.31" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> spent many evenings in the family group around
the fireside, and we regarded him as practically one of the family. His family,
which had been quite wealthy, were Virginians, who had moved to <A NAME="Oxford.33" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>, Miss.
He was, in many respects, one of the most remarkable men that I have ever
known. He had a brilliant mind, a photographic memory and a delightful personality.
As a student at the University he had stood very high in his classes with
very little effort. He was the ring leader in a small group of kindred spirits
(all with liberal allowances from well to do families) who organized the
first fraternity there -- primarily for the purpose of raising all the devilment
they could on the campus. Some of their doings were so frowned upon by the
Faculty that they felt that they had to make an example of <A NAME="Skipwith.41" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> in order
to maintain proper discipline, and a few days before his class graduated
he was notified that he would not be given a diploma on account of his misconduct.
It was typical of him, however, that out of the four speeches that were made
by members of the class at Graduation Exercises three were written by Skipwith.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I
recall one incident of his student days that he told us about. The fraternity,
for some reason, did not like one of the professors. He had just bought a
new carriage, and they decided to take it out of his stable, pull it down
hill to a valley about half a mile away and hide it there. Just as they reached
the valley the back curtains were opened and the Professor stepped out and
said, "Thank you very much for the ride, young gentlemen, I enjoyed it very
much. Now if you will please be so good as to pull me back up the hill to
my stable it will add still more to the pleasure that you have given me."
They had no alternative but to do so somewhat sheepishly. A week or so later
they decided the time had come to get even with him. He kept quite a flock
of chickens. These chickens rested in a large peach tree in his yard, and
they thought it would be fun to steal some of these chickens one night and
have a chicken dinner at the Fraternity House. So several of them, with a
large bag, proceeded to the tree. One of them climbed it and began passing
the chickens down to the other boys, who held the bag on the ground. Before
he could begin the Professor quietly approached the tree. The boys with the
sack were surprised, and, dropping the bag, they quickly ran away, hoping
that the Professor would follow them and give the boy up the tree an opportunity
to get away. The Professor, however, quietly picked up the bag. The boy up
the tree, having observed none of this, passed down a fat hen, saying as
he did so, "Here's Miss <A NAME="Lucy.66" HREF="index.html#Lucy">Lucy</A> (the name of the Professor's wife)." He then
passed down a fryer, saying "Here's <A NAME="Anna Belle.67" HREF="index.html#Anna Belle">Anna Belle</A> (the professor's daughter)."
When he had finished passing down about half a dozen chickens he climbed
down and was thunderstruck to see the Professor holding the bag of chickens.
The Professor said, casually, "Thank you very much Mr. ------ for your thoughtfulness.
We have been wondering how we could catch those chickens, and I don't know
how we could have done it without your kind assistance." After a pause he
added, "Mrs. ------- (his wife) and I would be very glad if you and your
assistants would have chicken dinner with us next Sunday." When they all
sat down at the table, the Professor, who was serving, said to the first
boy, "Would you prefer the breast or the drumstick of Miss <A NAME="Lucy.76" HREF="index.html#Lucy">Lucy</A>?" Everyone
present enjoyed themselves. The Professor had made no report of their misadventures,
and the Fraternity decided that the Professor was a good sort of guy after
all, and they were glad to be friends of him and his family thereafter.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Mr.
<A NAME="Skipwith.80" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> had many interesting experiences. He lived much in <A NAME="New York.80" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> and
he had travelled much in this country and abroad. He told us many stories
about his experiences. Several of these that I remember might, I think, be
of some interest to you, and I hope to tell you about them later. (Note:
In order to preserve some degree of continuity in my narrative I shall, if
I get to it, insert them in an Appendix.)<P ALIGN=LEFT>As a boy I was much interested
in railroading. The Division Superintendent of the <A NAME="Frisco.86" HREF="index.html#Frisco">Frisco</A> Railroad was a
friend and patient of Father's, and through him I was allowed to spend several
summers in the Railroad station at <A NAME="Winslow.88" HREF="index.html#Winslow">Winslow</A>, <A NAME="Ark.88" HREF="index.html#Ark">Ark</A>. (In the <A NAME="Boston.88" HREF="index.html#Boston">Boston</A> mountains,
where we spent the summers) studying telegraphy and doing much of the routine
work of the office. I later spent one summer in the Chief Dispatcher's office
in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.91" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> and learned much about the problems of operating all kinds of
trains over a single track railroad. I also spent one summer in a Freight
Agent's office and learned something about the classification and handling
of freight.<P ALIGN=LEFT>For several years I spent my leisure Saturdays in the Job Printing
office of C. A. <A NAME="Lick.95" HREF="index.html#Lick">Lick</A>, where I learned how to set type, run a printing press
and bind books. Later Mr. Lick developed a process for printing the numbered
tickets for a theater or similar place which gave him practically a monopoly
in the printing of such tickets in the <A NAME="United States.98" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>. He became a millionaire
and was <A NAME="President.99" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the National Printer's Association.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I never received
any pay for any of these activities, but I found them all interesting and
instructive. My experience in a Printing Office was quite useful to me later,
when, as Assistant Commandant of the Coast Artillery School, I had to organize
and re-equip the rather extensive Printing Plant of the School. <P ALIGN=LEFT>I enjoyed
the usual boys' games of the time (such as Prisoner's Base, Foot and a Half,
and baseball) but I was never an outstanding performer, as were both my brothers
later. However I and my brothers inherited father's fondness for horses.
I always had a pony and was very fond of riding, upon my proficiency in which
I prided myself.<P ALIGN=LEFT>When I was about twelve years old another boy (<A NAME="Douglas.108" HREF="index.html#Douglas">Douglas</A>
<A NAME="Rogers.109" HREF="index.html#Rogers">Rogers</A>) and I started out one day to have a race to see which of our two
ponies was the faster. It began to rain hard and we turned around and started
back home. I was riding at a gallop, with one foot in the stirrup and with
my head down (against the rain) along 6th street, then about to be paved,
when my pony, unexpectedly to me, reached a corner and suddenly turned up
a side street towards home. The saddle turned, my foot went through the stirrup,
and the pony dragged me for some distance, throwing me against some piles
of bricks along the street. Finally my foot came loose and I lay in the street,
practically unconscious (the pony, although a wild one, had stopped and was
standing beside me), when some man came along and, after I had insisted I
was all right, put me back in the saddle and told me to go straight home.
The pony went home at a walk. I had fractured my skull, broken my collarbone
and dislocated my elbow. When father and another doctor had finished bandaging
me up I asked them if they thought my injuries would keep me from going to
<A NAME="West Point.123" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. I mention this because I believe this was the first time I had
ever mentioned West Point. I have no idea how or when I first heard of West
Point or when I first decided that I wanted to go there. I had never seen
an Army officer and I knew nothing about the Army. I believe it was West
Point itself that attracted me, without any consideration of the fact that
it normally led to an Army career. <P ALIGN=LEFT>I graduated in 1899 from the High School
at 16. (I had skipped the 3rd and the 7th grades in the Grade School). The
High School provided three courses: Classical, Modern Languages, and Scientific.
Some students, taking but one of the regular courses, were able to graduate
in three years instead of four. Father, however, encouraged me to take the
full four years but to take two courses, the Classical and the Modern Languages.
In addition, he induced the School Board to set up a two year course in Greek.
I think I was the only one who ever took that course. Accordingly, I studied
Latin, <A NAME="French.136" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>, <A NAME="German.136" HREF="index.html#German">German</A>, and Greek, all of which, except perhaps Latin, I enjoyed.
One of my teachers stands out in my mind: Miss <A NAME="Effie.137" HREF="index.html#Effie">Effie</A> Lemons, who taught me
English Literature for four years. She was a remarkable teacher, and I learned
more from her than from all the other teachers that I had in that subject
later on. The Principal of the High School, B. W. <A NAME="Torreyson.140" HREF="index.html#Torreyson">Torreyson</A>, also stands
out in my memory. He was a fine teacher (he taught History), a firm but fair
disciplinarian, a man of the highest character and integrity -- and I have
always remembered him with admiration and respect.<P ALIGN=LEFT>One incident in connection
with my Graduation exercises stands out in my memory. I was one of the half
dozen graduates who, as a result of their class standing, were to make a
speech at these exercises. I had much difficulty in selecting a subject for
my speech. One evening while I was thinking the matter over, Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.147" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>
asked me what I was studying about and I told him. He studied a moment and
the said, "Why don't you write on '<A NAME="Bacon.149" HREF="index.html#Bacon">Bacon</A> and Greens'? Some years ago Governor
<A NAME="Bob.150" HREF="index.html#Bob">Bob</A> <A NAME="Taylor.150" HREF="index.html#Taylor">Taylor</A>, of <A NAME="Tennessee.150" HREF="index.html#Tennessee">Tennessee</A>, one of the most famous speakers in the South, made
his reputation by a speech on that subject. Suppose I dictate a few notes
on this subject tomorrow and see how you like it." I gladly accepted the
offer and the next day he gave me the manuscript. I liked it very much, and,
making a few changes and additions to salve my conscience I submitted it
to Miss Lemons for her approval. In a few days she returned it to me and
complimented me on it. She said that she liked it because it was different
and because it sounded so much like me. She added that she had made a few
minor changes which she thought might improve it a little. The changes made,
I found, consisted mostly in deleting most of the additions to Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.159" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>'s
draft that I had made. At the Exercises, "<A NAME="Bacon.160" HREF="index.html#Bacon">Bacon</A> and Greens", which was preceded
by a boy who spoke on "Our Policy in the <A NAME="Philippines.161" HREF="index.html#Philippines">Philippines</A>" and was followed by
a girl who spoke on "Beyond the <A NAME="Alps.162" HREF="index.html#Alps">Alps</A> Lies <A NAME="Italy.162" HREF="index.html#Italy">Italy</A>", made quite a hit with the
audience of proud parents and friends, and, for the moment, my reputation
as a speaker was high. A few days later the Alumni Association gave us new
graduates a dinner. Just before we sat down I learned, for the first time,
that the <A NAME="President.166" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Association would, as usual on the occasion, make
an address of welcome and that I (being Class President) would, of course,
make a speech in reply. I sat through the meal in despair, trying to think
of something to say that would be appropriate and that might sustain my newly
acquired reputation as a speaker. My thoughts didn't seem to jell much, and
when the time came for me to reply to the carefully prepared address of welcome
(to the preparation of which the speaker had undoubtedly devoted much toil
and sweat -- if not tears) my impromptu remarks were noteworthy only for
their brevity,and, in my own mind at least, my reputation as a speaker rapidly
approached the vanishing point. <P ALIGN=LEFT>I learned two lessons from all this. I
never again made a speech that I had not written, and I always made it a
practice whenever attending any public function to prepare in advance something
-- preferably something brief -- to say if I was called upon to speak.<P ALIGN=LEFT>When
I graduated from the High School my plans for the future centered about West
Point. It would be about two years before a vacancy occurred for our Congressional
District. There appeared to be no alternative to waiting for a chance at
this appointment, meanwhile going to college somewhere and beginning a college
course that would prepare me for whatever business or profession that I might
decide upon if I didn't get an appointment. I studied the catalogs of many
universities, but their costs seemed prohibitive. I finally decided upon
the University of <A NAME="Arkansas.186" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A>, at <A NAME="Fayetteville.186" HREF="index.html#Fayetteville">Fayetteville</A>, Arkansas, where I spent a year.
I was classified as a Freshman, but I was allowed to take Sophomore Latin
and, finally, <A NAME="Junior.188" HREF="index.html#Junior">Junior</A> Greek. I lived at the student Dormitory in order to
minimize my expenses, which amounted to only about $25 a month.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Shortly
before the end of the school year Congress passed a law authorizing each
Senator to appoint a candidate to <A NAME="West Point.191" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. These candidates were to report
in a few weeks and, if admitted, were to join in the regular class that had
entered several weeks before.<P ALIGN=LEFT>At that time the two Senators from <A NAME="Arkansas.193" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A>
were Senators <A NAME="Jones.194" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A> and <A NAME="Berry.194" HREF="index.html#Berry">Berry</A>. Jones was Chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. Father regarded him as a cheap politician and had told him so.
Senator Berry was a fine, old, one legged <A NAME="Confederate.196" HREF="index.html#Confederate">Confederate</A> veteran from a little
town near <A NAME="Fayetteville.197" HREF="index.html#Fayetteville">Fayetteville</A>, and father decided to seek the appointment from him.
He had a number of his friends write to Senator Berry, and a number of my
Professors at the University very kindly wrote similar letters. I received
a note from the Senator stating that he planned to be at the hotel in Fayetteville
on a certain date soon and asking me to call on him at that time. When I
did so I was surprised to find <A NAME="Joe.202" HREF="index.html#Joe">Joe</A> <A NAME="McAndrew.202" HREF="index.html#McAndrew">McAndrew</A>, a Senior whom I knew only slightly,
also there to see the Senator. We both went in together, Senator <A NAME="Berry.203" HREF="index.html#Berry">Berry</A> (whom
I had never seen before) turned to me and said, "Young man, I have received
some very fine letters from some of the best friends I have in the State,
and also from some of the Professors at the University, about you. I want
to tell you that there is but one boy in the world to whom I would give preference
to you for this appointment to <A NAME="West Point.208" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. He is Joe McAndrew here. His father
and I have been close friends all our lives. I promised him when <A NAME="Joe.209" HREF="index.html#Joe">Joe</A> was
born that if he ever wanted to go to West Point I would try to get him an
appointment. I am going to give the appointment as Principal to Joe here.
I shall be very glad to give you the appointment as Alternate if you want
it." Never having been outside <A NAME="Arkansas.213" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> bu once (when I went back to <A NAME="Oxford.213" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>
to visit my grandparents) I was glad to avail myself of the opportunity to
at least go to <A NAME="West Point.215" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> and to learn something about it perhaps that might
be of help in getting the next Congressional appointment. There was only
about two weeks time to prepare for the entrance examinations. I hurried
home. Father had arranged to hire a young lawyer who had just graduated in
law and who had taught a country school, to come to our home, share my room
with me and coach me for the examinations. He worked me for about fourteen
hours each day for the period of ten or twelve days available, at the end
of which I was by no means confident of being able to pass the entrance examinations.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Father
had had occasion several times to take patients to <A NAME="Johns.223" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.223" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> for operations,
and it had been his ambition for a long time to be able to take a postgraduate
course there himself. He finally decided that he would take the trip to West
Point with me, leaving me there and going on himself to <A NAME="Baltimore.226" HREF="index.html#Baltimore">Baltimore</A> and Johns
Hopkins.
