37. IN COMMAND OF THE FOURTH AA COMMAND.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
On December 18th, having been ordered to Headquarters, WDC at the <A NAME="Presidio.22" HREF="index.html#Presidio">Presidio</A>,
<A NAME="San Francisco.23" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A>, I was assigned to command of the Fourth Antiaircraft Artillery
Command, which included all the AA troops in the Western Defense Command.
Most of my staff at Camp <A NAME="Haan.25" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A> were also ordered to WDC Headquarters.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In the meantime the two Brigades had arrived at <A NAME="Seattle.28" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A> and at <A NAME="San Diego.28" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>
and were busily engaged in preparing plans for the AA defense of the <A NAME="Bremerton.29" HREF="index.html#Bremerton">Bremerton</A>
Navy Yard and the <A NAME="Boeing.30" HREF="index.html#Boeing">Boeing</A> Airplane plant at Seattle and of the big airplane
plant at San Diego.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As an example of the problems confronting these Brigade Commanders, the case
of Gen. <A NAME="Curtis.35" HREF="index.html#Curtis">Curtis</A> (a National Guard officer and an outstanding AA Brigade Commander)
was typical.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He lived at <A NAME="Harrisburg.39" HREF="index.html#Harrisburg">Harrisburg</A>, <A NAME="Pennsylvania.39" HREF="index.html#Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</A>. One day he received telegraphic orders
directing him to proceed to <A NAME="San Diego.40" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>, <A NAME="California.40" HREF="index.html#California">California</A> and assume command of the 33rd
AA Brigade. He arrived at San Diego one afternoon and learned that the Brigade
would arrive next morning. He had no staff of any kind, had never been in
San Diego, and had no idea as to what installations there required AA protection,
or as to what provision could be made for shelter for the troops or for emplacing
the armament when it became available.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(As a matter of fact he was never furnished any sort of a plan for the AA
defense of <A NAME="San Diego.49" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A> -- no such plan had ever been prepared.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
By inquiring at the hotel he ascertained that the only Army installation
at San Diego was the Coast Artillery at Fort <A NAME="Rosencrans.53" HREF="index.html#Rosencrans">Rosencrans</A>. About midnight he
called up the Commanding Officer at Fort Rosencrans (Colonel <A NAME="Ottosen.54" HREF="index.html#Ottosen">Ottosen</A>), explained
the situation and asked if Colonel Ottosen knew of any plan that existed
for the AA defense of <A NAME="San Diego.56" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>. Colonel Ottosen told him that he believed
that there was, in his safe at Headquarters, a study that had been made by
some officer in the Officer's School a year or so ago. General <A NAME="Curtis.58" HREF="index.html#Curtis">Curtis</A> went
out to Fort Rosencrans and spent the remainder of he night conferring with
Colonel Ottosen and some of his staff officers, and together they made up
a rough plan.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Early next morning, the Brigade began to arrive. The trains were met by General
<A NAME="Curtis.65" HREF="index.html#Curtis">Curtis</A> and each unit was conducted, by an officer loaned by Colonel <A NAME="Ottosen.65" HREF="index.html#Ottosen">Ottosen</A>,
to its tentatively selected area. General Curtis did a remarkably efficient
job of organizing a staff, preparing a complete War Plan, locating and installing
all the guns, searchlights and communications, and providing for the shelter
and supply of his Brigade, in large part before I arrived, after organizing
the Fourth AA Command.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I established my Headquarters in the same building with the Fighter Command,
in <A NAME="Oakland.74" HREF="index.html#Oakland">Oakland</A>, <A NAME="California.74" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>, in order to facilitate cooperation between the two
commands. Fortunately, during much of the time thereafter Col. <A NAME="Kepner.75" HREF="index.html#Kepner">Kepner</A> (then
a Major General), who had commanded the Fighter Unit during the Joint Exercise
in <A NAME="North Carolina.77" HREF="index.html#North Carolina">North Carolina</A> with such success as to strengthen greatly the interest
of the Air Corps in Fighters, was in command of the Fighter Command and our
relations were most pleasant and the cooperation between the two commands
was complete and effective.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
All the Brigades were equipped with the old 3" AA guns, with some 37mm. guns
and cal. 30 machine guns, and with searchlights and sound locators; there
may have been a few 268 Radars that had very recently been received.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Balloons and Balloon Companies were, as soon as possible, made available
for the defense of the <A NAME="Bremerton.89" HREF="index.html#Bremerton">Bremerton</A> Navy Yard (they had previously been made
available for the Naval and marine facilities, including a large dry dock,
in the <A NAME="San Francisco.91" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> area.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall quite vividly an incident relating to the balloon installation in
<A NAME="Seattle.95" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A>. General Marshall, Chief of Staff, was greatly concerned about the
defense of the <A NAME="Bremerton.96" HREF="index.html#Bremerton">Bremerton</A> Navy Yard, and as soon as the balloons were received
he began pressing General <A NAME="DeWitt.97" HREF="index.html#DeWitt">DeWitt</A> to expedite their installation in every
way possible and he wanted daily reports as to the progress made. This pressure
was, of course, transmitted to me, and by me to the 39th Brigade Commander
at Seattle, with considerable amplification. The problem there was a most
difficult one as the balloons had to be installed in a very rough area covered
with very large trees. The Engineer Department, which was charged with the
preparation of the balloon sites, was doing everything possible to speed
up the work, but the progress was discouragingly slow. I was in daily telephone
communication with the Brigade Commander and finally about midnight one day
I got a report that the first balloon would be installed and put up before
morning. I went to bed with a feeling of relief. Next morning, when I reached
my office, I found awaiting me a message stating that one of these balloons
had broken loose, dragging its steel mooring rope across both a 200000 volt
transmission line and a 100000 volt line, putting out the power supply of
<A NAME="Seattle.111" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A> and of the adjacent airplane factories, and that all passengers in
elevators had been stuck in the elevators, between floors, for several hours,
and that all power consuming industries in Seattle had been out of service
for that period. In a short time dozens of telegrams began coming in from
Senators, Congressmen, and the Chamber of Commerce, the airplane factories
and every other conceivable agency or individual, protesting most strongly
about the damage that had resulted from the balloons and demanding that their
use be discontinued at once. This initial experience with balloons did not
augur particularly well for the future installation of several hundred balloons
in the Fourth AA Command. However, although we had practically nothing in
the way of instructions or manuals for balloons, we learned things the hard
way and there was never a repetition of this experience.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In the latter part of May General <A NAME="DeWitt.125" HREF="index.html#DeWitt">DeWitt</A> told me confidentially that General
Marshall, with one Staff officer, was arriving on a certain day on an unannounced
and secret visit to the Western Defense Command, that he desired particularly
to visit <A NAME="Los Angeles.128" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A> and <A NAME="San Diego.128" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A> and to inspect the AA defences there,
and that he desired me to accompany General Marshall and himself on the trip.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
This trip left a lasting impression on my mind and I believe you might be
interested in learning something of it.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
When we arrived at <A NAME="Los Angeles.136" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A> we went directly to the Airplane Plant. General
Marshall sent his card up to the <A NAME="President.137" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the company, with the word
that he desired to see him on a matter of great importance. In a short time
we were escorted up to the President's office. General Marshall introduced
himself and said that he would like very much to have the chief officials
of the company assembled so that he could talk to them, that he thought this
would save considerable time in the long run, and that time was of the utmost
importance. When the group, of perhaps half a dozen men, was assembled he
said, in substance: "Gentlemen, I am going to tell you some things that are
not known to more than half a dozen men in <A NAME="Washington.145" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>. For reasons that I
shall explain in a moment it is absolutely essential to the safety of the
<A NAME="United States.147" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> that no word that I have been here or of what I shall say shall
be repeated to anyone whatever at the present time, and I shall rely upon
you to take all steps to assure that this is done.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
We have information of the greatest reliability that two forces of the Japanese
fleet have just left Japanese ports. We know the composition of each of these
forces, and we know the nature of the cargoes on each vessel. We know, for
instance, that some 200000 Incendiary bombs are being carried. This would
indicate that an attack on a land installation is contemplated. We do not
know what the objective of either of these forces is. It seems likely that
at least one of these forces is intended to attack the <A NAME="Pacific.158" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> coast, and
it is for this reason that I am here.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
At the present time our Naval forces in the Pacific are widely scattered.
In the aggregate they are considerably weaker than the Japanese forces now
in route. As the result of a most careful consideration of all phases of
the matter by the highest officials in the Government it has been decided
to assemble every suitable ship we have in the <A NAME="Pacific.166" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A>, in the vicinity of
Midway Island, and to intercept and attack the Japanese Fleet in a decisive
engagement. This concentration is now under way and it is estimated that
the engagement will take place in about ten days. If we do not decisively
defeat the Japanese in the battle the likelihood of an attack on this coast
is great, and the airplane plants on the coast would undoubtedly constitute
the targets of primary importance.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
You have parked in your lot a considerable number of B52 Bombers that are
practically completed but that are awaiting some finishing touches of a relatively
minor nature. A successful air attack on your plant would almost certainly
result in the destruction of these planes. These planes constitute our most
potent weapon in the <A NAME="Pacific.179" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A>, and their loss would set back this war by at
least one year. It might even result in our defeat.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
If it should become known to the Japanese that we have this information about
their fleet, our source of information would undoubtedly be destroyed. Hence
the imperative need for secrecy.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I want every one of these planes that can possibly fly to be flown within
the next twenty four hours to safe Flying Fields in the Interior, and for
this purpose I shall make available to you enough Air Corps pilots to enable
this to be done."

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
General Marshall's words were received with the greatest attention. He was
assured that the company would do everything in its power to assist in carrying
out the plan indicated by General Marshall, and after a brief discussion
our party left and proceeded to <A NAME="San Diego.197" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>, where the same procedure was followed.
The plan was carried out as per schedule, and General Marshall's words and
his presence were kept profoundly secret by all concerned.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
That night, in our hotel, General Marshall had a conference with General
<A NAME="DeWitt.203" HREF="index.html#DeWitt">DeWitt</A> and myself in which I was questioned as to the nature and adequacy
of the AA defenses. I outlined the nature of the existing defense and pointed
out that its greatest weakness lay in its comparative ineffectiveness at
night. I further stated that, in my opinion, the most effective defense against
night attack would be a balloon barrage. In reply to General Marshall's searching
questions I told him that I understood that there were two partially trained
and equipped Battalions of Balloon troops under training at the Balloon Training
Center in <A NAME="Tennessee.210" HREF="index.html#Tennessee">Tennessee</A> and that, if made available at once, they would enable
a reasonably effective night defense to be established at <A NAME="Los Angeles.211" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A> and
<A NAME="San Diego.212" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>. He immediately got on the phone, talked to his office, in <A NAME="Washington.212" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>,
and had orders issued directing that these two Battalions proceed at once
to Los Angeles.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
There remained little more than a week to install a complete Balloon barrage
at each of these localities. This involved finding suitable sites for the
balloon beds and installations and preparing these sites for use.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Again the Engineers did a splendid job, with the assistance of details of
enlisted men from the AA Artillery Batteries in the area, who, I learned
later, worked continuously until many of them fainted.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I had no information as to just what items of equipment might be short, but
felt, from previous experience, that certain items essential for the operation
of the balloons would not accompany the Battalions. So I had drawings and
specifications prepared for these items and the Engineers again came to the
rescue and had them made and delivered by the time they were needed.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
When the trains got in the troops disembarked and unloaded the freight cars,
the materiel was sorted into piles each containing the equipment for one
balloon, and each Balloon crew, with its equipment was transported, by vehicles
from the AA troops, directly to its own site.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I was very glad indeed to be able to report to General Marshall, before the
Battle of Midway, that the balloon barrages to defend all the important Naval,
Marine, and Aviation facilities on the <A NAME="Pacific.242" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> coast were completely installed.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
However the AA defence proper was seriously inadequate and inefficient. We
still had the old 3" guns, a few 37 mm. guns, some 30 caliber machine guns
with only a limited amount of ammunition, and only a few of the 268 radars.
While it is true that in about a year later we had received 90 mm. guns,
40 mm. guns, caliber 50 machine guns and ammunition, and a few 547 radars,
at the time of the Battle of Midway neither the AA nor the Air Corps defenses
of the <A NAME="Pacific.251" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> coast were sufficiently equipped to repell a Japanese air
attack, particularly at night, and I have always thought that if they had
made such an attack immediately after <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.253" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>, or up to the time of
the Battle of Midway, it would, in all probability, have resulted in the
destruction of the greater part of our B52 producing plants.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I have wondered why the Japanese high command did not make the most of the
favorable situation for them immediately after Pearl Harbor and for some
months afterwards.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The strength of the Fourth AA Command at times exceeded 40000 officers and
enlisted men.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Among the problems that developed during its existence may be mentioned:

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(a) The entire command was maintained on a 24 hour alert continuously for
more than two years. This resulted in a serious morale problem, and special
effort was made to keep the enlisted men occupied. This was one reason why
much attention was given to the camouflaging of all installations. The men
took much pride in their camouflage, and they were encouraged to exercise
their ingenuity and to spend much of their time in maintaining and in modifying
it.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(b) AA regiments were frequently withdrawn from the command and sent to the
<A NAME="Pacific.280" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> area or to <A NAME="Alaska.280" HREF="index.html#Alaska">Alaska</A>. The AA defense is essentially an interlocking
defense, and each withdrawal of one or more regiments required that the remaining
regiments be redeployed to close the resultant gap in the AA defense. This
involved a great deal of time and work.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(c) Several negro regiments were at times assigned to the command, with consequent
problems in training and in morale.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(d) Chemical troops (negros) were assigned to all Brigades, and it was necessary
to develop plans for the installation and use of smoke producing apparatus
in heavily populated areas.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(e) The provision of shelter, messing facilities, communications and ammunition
storage facilities in metropolitan areas involved many new and difficult
problems.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(f) The fact that practically all commissioned and enlisted personnel of
the Brigades was replaced by limited service men (in order to make the original
personnel available for overseas duty) required that new recruits be trained
to replace all specialists and all noncommissioned officers, and that practically
all officers had to be trained before they could take over their duties.
The morale of the limited service men was very high. They seemed to be very
proud of the fact that they had been given an opportunity for active service,
many of them were well educated and quick to learn, they were eager to learn
and they worked arduously and uncomplainingly at the task.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(g) The fact that this was the first time that balloons in large numbers
had ever been installed in this country necessitated that the tactics and
technique of their emplacement and employment had, to a very large degree,
to be developed as the result of experience.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(h) In view of the limitations of the materiel available at the time it was
necessary to develop a method of conducting fire at unseen targets.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(i) When 40 mm. guns were received it became necessary to develop doctrine
covering their technical and tactical employment, including the design and
location of towers upon which to install them.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
(j) It was necessary to develop doctrine covering the location and employment
of the radar equipment as it became available.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
My relations with the Air Corps (Fighter Command) were, at all times, cordial
and the full cooperation that existed was satisfactory to all concerned.
The local Fighter Commander exercised Operational Control over the AA defenses
-- that is he decided when it was safe to them for the AA to open fire; he
exercised no command over the AA.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Air Corps Headquarters in <A NAME="Washington.337" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> had for some time been conducting
an active campaign to take over all the AA Artillery.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Early in 1944 this matter came to a head, and the Commanding General, Western
Defense Command, (Major General <A NAME="Emmons.342" HREF="index.html#Emmons">Emmons</A> -- incidentally formerly a prominent
officer in the Air Corps) was called upon to submit his recommendations.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The paper was referred to me, and I made a full discussion of the matter,
setting forth the reasons why I considered that such a transfer would be
detrimental to the AA Artillery and of no material advantage to the Air Corps.
General <A NAME="Emmons.349" HREF="index.html#Emmons">Emmons</A> concurred ion my views and strongly recommended against the
transfer. The transfer was disapproved by the War Department.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
At the time General <A NAME="Leslie.353" HREF="index.html#Leslie">Leslie</A> <A NAME="McNair.353" HREF="index.html#McNair">McNair</A>, Commander of the Army Ground Forces, was
in <A NAME="Europe.354" HREF="index.html#Europe">Europe</A>. General McNair, a classmate of mine, was one of a small group
of Field Artillery officers who had, for many years, been running the Filed
Artillery, and who had been very bitter against the Coast Artillery ever
since its separation from the Field Artillery in 1907. He was, however, a
brilliant and efficient officer, and he exerted a great influence on General
Marshall, the Chief of Staff. Shortly after the War Department had acted
on the paper he returned, from his trip, to the <A NAME="United States.360" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>. At the instigation
of the Air Corps he promptly rescinded the action previously taken by the
War Department, and orders were issued by the War Department placing the
Antiaircraft Artillery under the command of the Air Corps.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Commander of the Fourth Fighter Command at the time was Maj. Gen. <A NAME="Lind.366" HREF="index.html#Lind">Lind</A>.
He was much younger than me. In <A NAME="Hawaii.367" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>, when we had both been on a Joint
Air Corps - Coast Artillery Board, he had been a Major while I was a Major
General. I did not care, under all the circumstances, to serve under his
command and I requested that I be relieved from command of the Fourth Antiaircraft
Command and be ordered to other duty.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
My relief was effective April 24th, 1944, and I was ordered to report to
the Commanding General, Eastern Defense Command, for duty as Commanding General,
Northeast Sector.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During the time I was in command of the Fourth AA Command, <A NAME="Perry.379" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A> was, in
1942, ordered to <A NAME="San Diego.380" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A> with an 8" Railway Battery.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<A NAME="Shirley.383" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> (with two other young brides) drove from Fort <A NAME="Hancock.383" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A> to <A NAME="Riverside.383" HREF="index.html#Riverside">Riverside</A>,
<A NAME="California.384" HREF="index.html#California">California</A> to be with your grandmother; <A NAME="Mary.384" HREF="index.html#Mary">Mary</A> <A NAME="Katharine.384" HREF="index.html#Katharine">Katharine</A> <A NAME="Eubank.384" HREF="index.html#Eubank">Eubank</A> was born on
October 5th, 1942 at the Community Hospital at Riverside.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Later <A NAME="Perry.388" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A> was assigned to the AA Artillery and ordered to the AA School;
and your grandmother, mother and <A NAME="Kitty.389" HREF="index.html#Kitty">Kitty</A> went to <A NAME="Summerville.389" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A>, where they spent
the remainder of the War.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Your grandmother, during this period, had the old slave's quarters, in the
yard, near the house, rebuilt into the present Cabin, which she rented, at
a nominal price, to young officers and their wives having small babies, who
were unable to find habitable quarters elsewhere.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<A NAME="Milan.399" HREF="index.html#Milan">Milan</A> <A NAME="Weber.399" HREF="index.html#Weber">Weber</A>, who had been my Aide ever since I was promoted to Brigadier
General, was assigned to the 4th Army in September, 1943, and later went
overseas, where he served, with distinction, with the Antiaircraft Artillery
Section of the Army Headquarters.
