13. In the Coast Artillery<BR>
At Ft. <A NAME="Adams.16" HREF="index.html#Adams">Adams</A>
</H3>
<HR align=left>
I arrived at Fort Adams one afternoon (with a suitcase full of soiled
linen awaiting laundering) and reported at Post Headquarters. I was considerably
taken back to learn that the Commanding Officer was Colonel <A NAME="Walter.21" HREF="index.html#Walter">Walter</A> <A NAME="Howe.21" HREF="index.html#Howe">Howe</A>,
who had been in command of the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade at Ft.
<A NAME="Sill.23" HREF="index.html#Sill">Sill</A> in 1905, and whom I considered to be an irascible old <A NAME="Indian.23" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A> fighter.
I was surprised at the warmth of his welcome - until he said: "I am certainly
glad to see you. I have been ordered to send a Lieutenant to <A NAME="Portland.25" HREF="index.html#Portland">Portland</A>, <A NAME="Maine.25" HREF="index.html#Maine">Maine</A>,
for a two weeks Exercise to be conducted there, and the only one available
is my Quartermaster, whom I can't well spare. You arrive just in time to
take his place." He loaded me (and my soiled clothes) onto a truck and it
speeded into <A NAME="Newport.29" HREF="index.html#Newport">Newport</A> just in time for me to catch the train.<P>Upon my return
to Fort <A NAME="Adams.30" HREF="index.html#Adams">Adams</A> I reported to the 129th Company Commander for duty. The company
was just being organized and it consisted of about 30 men, who had been sent
to Fort Adams against their desires. It had no trained Cook, no Mess Sergeant
and no Company Clerk, until I could train men for these jobs.<P>When we went
out to parades, we had three squads of men in ranks and I was in the fileclosers.
When I paused to think that for the last three months, while at Fort <A NAME="Riley.35" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>,
I had been in command (temporarily) of the Battery of some 150 men and 200
horses, and had frequently taken them out for a three day march in whatever
direction I chose, I wondered again if I had done wisely in transferring
out of the Field Artillery.<P>In about six months (and before our casemate
equipment had been received) I was relieved from assignment to the 129th
Company and was made Ordnance Officer of the Coast Defenses of <A NAME="Narragansett.41" HREF="index.html#Narragansett">Narragansett</A>
Bay. As such one of my first jobs was to take over seventeen Batteries that
had just been completed by the Engineers at Forts <A NAME="Wetherill.43" HREF="index.html#Wetherill">Wetherill</A>, <A NAME="Getty.43" HREF="index.html#Getty">Getty</A> and <A NAME="Kearny.43" HREF="index.html#Kearny">Kearny</A>,
and this kept me fully occupied for some time.<P>I recall one or two incidents
that occurred during this period.<P>In those days each officer was, by Regulations,
authorized an annual allowance of stationery, in such quantities as might
be approved by the Commanding Officer. Not having drawn any stationery for
several years at Fort <A NAME="Riley.48" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>, I decided to submit a requisition. Having learned
that Col .<A NAME="Howe.49" HREF="index.html#Howe">Howe</A> checked every stationery requisition, I went to the Q.M. clerk
who handled such matters and asked him to make out for me a requisition for
such amounts as he knew from experience would be considered proper by Colonel
Howe. Next morning, just as I was preparing to leave my quarters, I saw the
Orderly doubletiming up the hill from Headquarters to my quarters. Upon arriving,
out of breath, he said, "Sir, the Adjutant's compliments to the Lieutenant
and the Commanding Officer wishes to see the Lieutenant in his office right
away." Considering that the Orderly had doubletimed up the hill, I thought
that the urgency was sufficiently great to require me to doubletime down
it. I reported to Colonel <A NAME="Howe.58" HREF="index.html#Howe">Howe</A> in his office and the following conversation
took place:<P>"Young man, what in the hell do you mean by submitting such
a blank blank stationery requisition as this?"<P>"Well Sir, I haven't drawn
any stationery for the past two years and I needed some stationery..."<P>"Do
you think I am going to pay up all the back debts of the Quartermaster Department
for stationery?"<P>"No Sir, I just needed some envelopes ---"<P>"What in
the hell can a 2nd Lieutenant need 50 official envelopes for?"<P>"Well Sir,
I didn't expect to use them except as I needed them. I understood that you
were very particular about stationery requisitions and I went to the Q.M.
clerk who handles them and asked him to make out for me a requisition which,
from experience, he felt sure you would approve ---"<P>"Yes; that's just
the trouble with the Army nowadays. The damned Lieutenants don't know how
to make out any Forms at all, and they have to run to some clerk to get him
to do it for them."<P>I could think of nothing entirely suitable to add to
the subject, so I remained quiet. He finally approved 25 envelopes and I
returned (at a wlk, incidently) to my quarters.<P>About that time a very
beautiful girl, named <A NAME="Bianca.74" HREF="index.html#Bianca">Bianca</A> <A NAME="Cogswell.74" HREF="index.html#Cogswell">Cogswell</A>, daughter of the Commandant of the
<A NAME="Portsmouth.75" HREF="index.html#Portsmouth">Portsmouth</A> Navy Yard, came to the Naval Torpedo Station to visit the <A NAME="Gleaves.75" HREF="index.html#Gleaves">Gleaves</A>
(Commander <A NAME="Albert.76" HREF="index.html#Albert">Albert</A> Gleaves was in command). She was very popular and, at the
insistence of Lieut. D. C. <A NAME="Bingham.77" HREF="index.html#Bingham">Bingham</A>, of the Navy, and myself, she extended
her visit by several weeks. Finally, however, to our mutual regret, she had
to go home (by the 11 o'clock train from <A NAME="Newport.79" HREF="index.html#Newport">Newport</A>). I conceived the brilliant
idea of going over to see her off on the train. However there was a Post
order that no officer could leave the Post before 12 o'clock without the
personal authority in each case of the Commanding Officer. So I decided to
beard the lion in his den, and I went in to Colonel <A NAME="Howe.83" HREF="index.html#Howe">Howe</A>, saluted, and said,
"Sir, I would like to have permission to go to town on the 10 o'clock boat."
He said, "Don't you know that Post orders prescribe that no officer can leave
the Post before 12 o'clock?" I replied, "No Sir, I understood that the orders
prescribed that no officer could leave the Post before 12 o'clock without
the personal permission of the Commanding Officer, and it was my desire to
secure such permission." He asked me why I desired to go to town. I replied
that it was for entirely personal reasons -- that there was a young lady
who was leaving on the 11 o'clock train, and that I had promised, subject
to his approval, to come over and see her off. Finally he said, "Young man,
what is this young lady to you?" I was stumped for the moment, but, after
giving the matter some thought, I replied, "Well Sir, that is one of the
things I thought I might be able to find out by going over to see her off."
He didn't exactly smile, but his eyes sparkled a little and he concluded
the interview by saying, "Well, you may go this once. But don't consider
that this constitutes a precedent."<P><A NAME="Bingham.98" HREF="index.html#Bingham">Bingham</A> and I arrived at the station
at the same time, he entering one end door with some flowers and I entering
the other with a box of candy (or vice versa). We both sat down by the young
lady. The conversation lagged until the Conductor called out "All aboard."
Neither of us would budge. Neither of us could visualize with any degree
of equanimity a continuation of the threesome for the next half hour or so.
However, as the train began to get up speed we both made a break for the
doors and each of us dropped off from his respective end of the car in time
to wave a not too enthusiastic farewell. I never saw her again. Some twenty
years later she married <A NAME="Bingham.107" HREF="index.html#Bingham">Bingham</A> (she had been married twice in the meantime).<P>In
those days we had very few submarines in our Navy. One of these was based
at the Naval Torpedo Station. I met the young Lieutenant in command and was
attracted by his quiet and efficient manner. He invited me to spend a day
submerged in <A NAME="Narragansett.111" HREF="index.html#Narragansett">Narragansett</A> Bay with him, and I accepted the rather unusual
invitation with pleasure. He lived aboard the tender <A NAME="Nina.112" HREF="index.html#Nina">Nina</A> and he suggested
that I dine with him and spend the night with him before going out on the
submarine next day. In the course of our conversation, after dinner, it developed
that he was from <A NAME="Texas.115" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>. I told him that I had been stationed at Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.115" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, 
and that my Battery had gone up to <A NAME="Kerrville.116" HREF="index.html#Kerrville">Kerrville</A>, Texas, in 1905 for
target practice. He said his home was not far from Kerrville and asked me
if I knew the Kerrville Hotel. I told him that I knew it quite well -- that
there had been a very pretty young girl, a TB patient, whose family in the
<A NAME="Midwest.120" HREF="index.html#Midwest">Midwest</A> had sent her to Kerrville for her health, who lived at the Hotel,
that I had felt very sorry for her and had taught her to ride. He seemed
interested and said, "Did you teach her to shoot a rifle too?" I was surprised
and I replied that I had indeed done that too. He smiled and said, "Well
that explains something I never quite understood. I spent several weeks at
the hotel when I was on furlough in 1906. I met her too, I felt sorry for
her too, and I taught her to shoot a rifle too. I wondered how she learned
to do it so quickly." A week or so later the <A NAME="Nina.127" HREF="index.html#Nina">Nina</A> (without the Lieutenant)
left <A NAME="Newport.128" HREF="index.html#Newport">Newport</A> for <A NAME="Norfolk.128" HREF="index.html#Norfolk">Norfolk</A> to undergo some repairs. She disappeared at sea
and no sign of her was ever found. Her loss became one of the mysteries of
the sea. The name of the Lieutenant was <A NAME="Chester.130" HREF="index.html#Chester">Chester</A> W. <A NAME="Nimitz.130" HREF="index.html#Nimitz">Nimitz</A>.<P>My brother <A NAME="Dan.130" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A>
had been admitted to <A NAME="West Point.131" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> the year before. He had made the first team
in Baseball and probably would have made the first team in Football. However,
he had not done so well in Mathematics and had been found deficient, and
been discharged, at the end of his Plebe year. He had made up his mind to
get an appointment in the Marine Corps, had been designated to take the competitive
examination, and was at the <A NAME="Dowd.136" HREF="index.html#Dowd">Dowd</A> Preparatory School in <A NAME="Washington.136" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>. About
three weeks before the examination he wrote me that there were so many students
in the class that he wasn't learning much and that he was sure that he would
not be prepared to take the examination. I got a 17 day leave and went to
Washington. I took him out of Dowd's and sat beside him, coaching him, for
at least fourteen hours a day. I worked out all the Arithmetic problems given
on previous occasions and made him understand them. He had to major in one
of several optional subjects, such as Higher Mathematics, Mechanics, <A NAME="French.143" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>
-- in none fo which he had the necessary preparation. I decided to have him
major in "History of the English Language", which covered, among other things,
Anglo-Saxon grammar, including conjugations, declensions, etc. (about which
neither of us knew anything). I took the text books themselves. Knowing that
in previous examinations the candidate had sometimes been required to write
a 500 word composition, I wrote one on "The U. S. Marine Corps" and had him
memorize it. It was all a gruelling experience for him, but he gritted his
teeth and took it cheerfully. He passed the examinations and was admitted
to the Marine Corps. Among other things he was required to write a 500 word
Composition -- and I feel quite sure that he chose as a subject "The U. S.
Marine Corps".<P>Upon my return to Fort <A NAME="Adams.154" HREF="index.html#Adams">Adams</A> I was met on the dock by Lieut.
<A NAME="Frank.155" HREF="index.html#Frank">Frank</A> <A NAME="Phipps.155" HREF="index.html#Phipps">Phipps</A>, (the Quartermaster), a former classmate at <A NAME="West Point.155" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, who
announced to me, with great glee, that I had been appointed Adjutant. I was
very unhappy about this. From my infrequent contacts with Col. <A NAME="Howe.157" HREF="index.html#Howe">Howe</A>, I regarded
him as an arbitrary and dictatorial martinet of the first water, and I did
not relish the prospect of being his Adjutant.<P>I served as his Adjutant
for about a year. When I got to know him I found that he was an entirely
different sort of man from what I had thought him to be. I found that neither
his wife nor anyone else's wife was running the Post, and that, as a matter
of fact, he had the very highest sense of duty, with which he allowed no
personal or social considerations to interfere in the slightest degree. I
came, in time, to respect him and to be glad to do everything I could to
be of help to him.
