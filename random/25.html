25. CAMP EUSTIS, VA.

<HR>


<P>
We arrived at <A NAME="Eustis.22" HREF="index.html#Eustis">Eustis</A> September 16, 1922.

<P>
I was assigned as Executive Officer in the 52nd Coast Artillery (Railway)
Regiment, equipped with 8" Railway guns.

<P>
The system of Fire Control used by the Railway Artillery during the War and
then still in use, was very slow, it being necessary to rest the Plotting
Board for data for each separate gun in the Battery. There were some bright
young officers in the Regiment, and I got them interested in the development
of a new system of Fire Control, quite similar to that I had used while in
the Field Artillery, in which only one deflection was set up on the Plotting
Board, it being corrected by a convergence correction applied to the individual
guns of the Battery, the issue sights being modified by us to enable this
to be done. The modified sight was later adopted by the Ordnance Department
as standard.

<P>
We were assigned quarters in one end of a war time hospital (of temporary
construction), which had been converted into two officer's quarters, Beaver
board partitions having been installed to divide the area into rooms. None
of the walls were painted. I hired several soldiers to help me paint them
(after hours), and in about two months we were quite comfortably settled.
I recall that about the last thing needed to be done was to hang curtains
on the enclosed porch, which had seventeen windows, and your grandmother
had gone, with Mrs. <A NAME="Cloke.48" HREF="index.html#Cloke">Cloke</A> (the wife of the Commanding Officer, Camp <A NAME="Eustis.48" HREF="index.html#Eustis">Eustis</A>)
to <A NAME="Newport.49" HREF="index.html#Newport">Newport</A> News one afternoon to buy the necessary curtain material. During
the preceding years, since our marriage, we had had household effects stored
in four or five different warehouses, and feeling that at last we could expect
to be settled long enough to use them to advantage, I had had them shipped
to me at Camp Eustis. They arrived the afternoon that your grandmother went
shopping for the curtains, and upon her return we worked until late that
night unpacking the various boxes and barrels (with much wonder and anticipation
as to what the next one might contain), and then I carried them all out and
left them on the lawn for the Provost Sergeant to pick up next day.

<P>
Upon reaching my office the next morning I found awaiting me a telegram relieving
me from duty at Camp <A NAME="Eustis.61" HREF="index.html#Eustis">Eustis</A> in time to sail for the <A NAME="Panama.61" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> <A NAME="Canal.61" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A> Department
on the transport leaving <A NAME="New York.62" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> in about ten days. (I was later told that
this sudden move was due to the fact that, under the new Class B procedure,
a major in Panama had just been Class B'd and relieved from duty and a replacement
for him had become necessary.) I telephoned the Provost Sergeant not to pick
up the empty containers, and we worked until late that night repacking the
barrels and boxes we had so gleefully unpacked the night before. I think
this probably established a record of some kind -- but of what kind I am
not altogether sure.

<P>
The Quartermaster told me that if I could turn all the household goods over
to him by a certain date, he was confident they could reach the Port of Embarkation
in time for shipment to <A NAME="Panama.74" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> with us. We worked with the packing detail
nearly all day and night for several days, and met the date line.

<P>
We left <A NAME="Eustis.78" HREF="index.html#Eustis">Eustis</A> on November 22nd, 1922, and arrived at the pier the day before
the transport was to sail, and, after much tracing of cars by the railroads,
we found that all our furniture was then in a railroad yard in <A NAME="Philadelphia.80" HREF="index.html#Philadelphia">Philadelphia</A>
and that it could not possibly be shipped on the transport. We were assured
however that it would be shipped on the next transport, about a month later.

<P>
When I got aboard the transport I received orders detailing me as Commanding
Officer of Troops. I had never been on a transport before and I had very
little idea as to what the duties of the Commanding Officer of Troops consisted
of. I found that there was no office space, and in fact no desk, on board
set aside for him, and there was no copy of any orders of the previous Troop
Commanders, and no copy of any Army Regulations or Transport Regulations
available for his use. I learned that the troops consisted of some 300 recruits,
with no company or other organization. For the first three days out of New
York it was so rough that all the recruits, who were in the hold, were thoroughly
and unqualifiedly sick and never appeared on deck. The job of cleaning up
the hold, organizing the troops, feeding them, preparing the necessary papers
required to effect their assignments on arrival did not leave me much time
to get sick -- or, I am afraid, to be of much value as what is nowaday known
as a baby sitter.

<P>
I may add that, as a result of the Report which I submitted upon completion
of the voyage, the QM Department was directed to provide suitable office
space, publications, etc. for the Commanding Officers of Troops on transports.
I took about half a dozen trips later on transports, and I believe I was
in command of troops each time. The provisions made for the Commanding Officer
of Troops were certainly much better than those existing on my first trip.
