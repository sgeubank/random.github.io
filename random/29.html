29. AT THE C&GS SCHOOL, FT. LEAVENWORTH

Upon the completion of the Advanced Course on July 15th, 1927, I, together
with all the graduates of the Advanced Course, was ordered to take the Course
at the Command and General Staff College, at Fort <A NAME="Leavenworth.24" HREF="index.html#Leavenworth">Leavenworth</A>, where I reported
on August 24th.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
We had a very nice apartment in a converted barracks, where <A NAME="Shirley.28" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> proceeded
to have a severe case of whooping cough.

I found the Course a useful one particularly in that it afforded me an opportunity
to gain some familiarity with the use and organization of the various Special
Troops of the Division, as well as with the tactical employment of the Infantry
Division. I believe the Course was advantageous to most of the officers who
took it, but I also believe that it was detrimental to a few of them who
seemed to become indoctrinated with the idea that almost any problem with
which they might, in future, be confronted might be solved by reference to
some problem which had, at some time, been issued at <A NAME="Leavenworth.39" HREF="index.html#Leavenworth">Leavenworth</A>, and, more
particularly, in the case of some Coast Artillery officers, that the same
detailed procedures there taught for the Division should necessarily be employed
in the Coast Artillery Harbor Defense.

I was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on <A NAME="March.45" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> 16th, 1928, and shortly before
graduation on June 15th, 1928, I received orders detailing me on the General
Staff and directing me to proceed to Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.47" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, <A NAME="Texas.47" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>, for duty on
the Corp Area General Staff. I was very glad to receive this assignment as
the Corp Area Commander at that time was Major General Wm. <A NAME="Lassiter.49" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>, under
whom I had served in <A NAME="Panama.50" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A>, and for whom I had great admiration and respect.
His Chief of Staff was Colonel <A NAME="Robert.51" HREF="index.html#Robert">Robert</A> <A NAME="McCleave.51" HREF="index.html#McCleave">McCleave</A>, a very fine officer, who
had been a classmate of mine at the Army War College.

Upon graduating from the C&GS School I had completed my military schooling.
However, the sequence: General Staff, General Staff Eligible List, Army War
College, C&GS School was just the reverse of the normal one.

Having received a month's leave we decided to drive leisurely from Ft. <A NAME="Leavenworth.60" HREF="index.html#Leavenworth">Leavenworth</A>
to Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.61" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, through country that was new to us. Our route was <A NAME="Lincoln.61" HREF="index.html#Lincoln">Lincoln</A>,
<A NAME="Nebraska.62" HREF="index.html#Nebraska">Nebraska</A> -- <A NAME="Denver.62" HREF="index.html#Denver">Denver</A> -- <A NAME="Colorado Springs.62" HREF="index.html#Colorado Springs">Colorado Springs</A> -- <A NAME="Santa Fe.62" HREF="index.html#Santa Fe">Santa Fe</A>, New <A NAME="Mexico.62" HREF="index.html#Mexico">Mexico</A> -- <A NAME="Cloudcroft.62" HREF="index.html#Cloudcroft">Cloudcroft</A>,
<A NAME="Texas.63" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A> (<A NAME="Cavalry.63" HREF="index.html#Cavalry">Cavalry</A> Division Rest Camp) -- <A NAME="Carlsbad.63" HREF="index.html#Carlsbad">Carlsbad</A>, <A NAME="New Mexico.63" HREF="index.html#New Mexico">New Mexico</A> (Carlsbad Caverns)
-- <A NAME="Alpine.64" HREF="index.html#Alpine">Alpine</A>, Texas -- <A NAME="Del Rio.64" HREF="index.html#Del Rio">Del Rio</A> -- Ft. <A NAME="Sam Houston.64" HREF="index.html#Sam Houston">Sam Houston</A>. The trip was very interesting
except that some days we had as many as four tire punctures. The old <A NAME="Spanish.65" HREF="index.html#Spanish">Spanish</A>
Trail, along the Border, over much of which we passed, was just a very muddy
road. The roads were so bad in Texas that it took us five hours to make the
last fifty miles into Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.68" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>.
