31. SERVICE IN HAWAII.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon the completion of my four years tour of duty with the General Staff,
on June 30th, 1932, I was ordered to <A NAME="Hawaii.23" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>, via the Transport Republic,
to sail from <A NAME="San Francisco.24" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> in October, upon the expiration of three months
leave which was granted me. We drove from Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.25" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> to <A NAME="Summerville.25" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A>,
via New <A NAME="Orleans.26" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A>, which we found to be quite interesting, especially the food
at <A NAME="Antoine.27" HREF="index.html#Antoine">Antoine</A>'s (I did not especially care for "<A NAME="Oysters.27" HREF="index.html#Oysters">Oysters</A> <A NAME="Rockefeller.27" HREF="index.html#Rockefeller">Rockefeller</A>".)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Shortly after arriving in Summerville, due to the failure of Congress to
enact an Army Appropriation <A NAME="Bill.31" HREF="index.html#Bill">Bill</A>, a system of "payless furloughs" was instituted
and all leaves of absence were cancelled, the officers concerned being directed
to report for temporary duty at a suitable location. I reported for duty
with the North <A NAME="Atlantic.34" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A> Coast Artillery District in <A NAME="New York.34" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> City. Shortly
afterwards I requested that I be authorized to embark on the Republic from
New York instead of from <A NAME="San Francisco.36" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A>, but for some reason that I could
never understand this request was disapproved and it became necessary for
me to transport my family (including myself) across the continent in order
to embark on the Republic at San Francisco.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
We decided that we might as well make the trip as enjoyable as possible,
so we took passage on the <A NAME="Grace.43" HREF="index.html#Grace">Grace</A> Line from <A NAME="New York.43" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> to <A NAME="San Francisco.43" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A>, touching
at many cities on the <A NAME="Atlantic.44" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A> and <A NAME="Pacific.44" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> coasts of Central America. The
trip was a most enjoyable one (especially as I was not this time in command
of troops), although about all that I now remember about it is that we bought
some big straw <A NAME="Mexican.47" HREF="index.html#Mexican">Mexican</A> hats at some place in <A NAME="Mexico.47" HREF="index.html#Mexico">Mexico</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon arriving in <A NAME="Honolulu.50" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A>, in October, 1932, I was assigned (by Brig. Gen.
<A NAME="Abernethy.51" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A>, Commanding the Hawaiian Separate Coast Artillery Brigade) to the
Harbor Defenses of <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.52" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>, Fort <A NAME="Kamehameha.52" HREF="index.html#Kamehameha">Kamehameha</A>, where I became Harbor Defense
Executive Officer.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall one incident that occurred while I was on this duty.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Major General B. H. <A NAME="Wells.59" HREF="index.html#Wells">Wells</A>, a very able and competent officer, was in command
of the Hawaiian Department. He was very much interested in the War Plan and
he arranged with the Navy for a Combined Navy--Coast Artillery Exercise to
involve a naval attack on <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.62" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>. I was in charge of the Coast Artillery
defense. Realizing that the Navy attack on Pearl Harbor would probably include
an attempt by a submarine to enter the dredged channel into Pearl Harbor,
I kept two Barrier Searchlights in position across the entrance constantly
all night, with an observer on a DPF instrument maintaining constant observation
of the two intersecting beams, and I personally kept them under observation
practically continuously. About 2:30 in the morning General <A NAME="Abernethy.68" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> called
me on the phone and said that General <A NAME="Wells.69" HREF="index.html#Wells">Wells</A> had called him and stated that
a submarine had just entered <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.70" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>. He was much exercised that it
had not been detected and fired upon. I informed General Abernethy that the
entrance had been under constant observation all night and that no submarine
had entered it. In a few minutes General Abernethy called me again and stated
that General Wells had again stated positively that a submarine had entered,
that the Coast Artillery had fallen down on their job and that he wanted
prompt and effective steps taken to prevent a recurrence of such manifest
inefficiency. I told General <A NAME="Abernethy.77" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> to tell General <A NAME="Wells.77" HREF="index.html#Wells">Wells</A> that I would
be personally responsible for the report that no submarine had entered during
the Exercise.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The official relations were quite strained during the remainder of the Exercise,
and I was by no means personally unconcerned.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
General <A NAME="Wells.86" HREF="index.html#Wells">Wells</A> called General <A NAME="Abernethy.86" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> next morning, stating that he had
personally arranged with the Admiral for a submarine to try to run through
the entrance at 2:30 a.m. but that he had just been advised by the Admiral
that, for some reason, it had been necessary to change the plans at the last


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
minute and to cancel the attempted run by of the submarine, although General
<A NAME="Wells.94" HREF="index.html#Wells">Wells</A> had not been notified of the change in plan. General Wells apologized
fully for his uncomplimentary and unfair remarks the night before, and at
the critique he complimented the Coast Artillery on its efficiency during
the Exercise.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Due to the expiration of the tour of duty of Colonel A. L. <A NAME="Fuller.100" HREF="index.html#Fuller">Fuller</A> as Chief
of Staff, HSCAB, General <A NAME="Abernethy.101" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> relieved me from duty with the Harbor
Defenses of <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.102" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A> and assigned me as Chief of Staff at his Headquarters,
with station at Fort <A NAME="DeRussy.103" HREF="index.html#DeRussy">DeRussy</A>, effective August 21st, 1933. I enjoyed this
duty, particularly in view of the fact that during the period of several
months that General Abernethy was on sick report I carried on the work of
the Headquarters.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During this period I was invited by Lt. Cmdr. <A NAME="Bayless.109" HREF="index.html#Bayless">Bayless</A>, Commander of the Coast
Guard <A NAME="Cutter.110" HREF="index.html#Cutter">Cutter</A> "<A NAME="Itasca.110" HREF="index.html#Itasca">Itasca</A>" to accompany him on an inspection trip to all the islands
of the <A NAME="Hawaii.111" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>an Islands west of Hawaii, including <A NAME="French.111" HREF="index.html#French">French</A> Frigate Shoal, <A NAME="Gardner.111" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>
Island, <A NAME="Laysan.112" HREF="index.html#Laysan">Laysan</A> Island, Midway Island and <A NAME="Kure.112" HREF="index.html#Kure">Kure</A> (Ocean) Island (about 1200
miles from <A NAME="Japan.113" HREF="index.html#Japan">Japan</A>). This was an interesting trip (June 18-28, 1934).

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
At that time Midway Island was used only as a submarine cable station, the
personnel of the station being quartered in a building very similar to an
Army barracks. These men had much free time, and they spent much of it in
studying the abundant bird and fish life at hand. All these islands were
uninhabited, except Midway. They are all bird refuges. On Midway, <A NAME="French.120" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>
Frigate Shoals and <A NAME="Laysan.121" HREF="index.html#Laysan">Laysan</A>, thousands and thousands of the North <A NAME="Atlantic.121" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A>
Albatross, or "gonies", arrive from <A NAME="Alaska.122" HREF="index.html#Alaska">Alaska</A> and the <A NAME="Arctic.122" HREF="index.html#Arctic">Arctic</A> region with the
first high winds in October and nest together on the open sand. They arrive,
to breed, almost on schedule time; so much so, in fact, that every year sweepstakes
are made up among the cable operators in connection with this event -- which
occurs about the 20th of October. They build their nests on the sand, and
the female lays only one egg.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
One of the cable operators told me about a little incident that I thought
rather amusing. He was out one day on the beach, which was covered with goney
nests, the females all setting on their single eggs. A female Frigate bird
(the hawks of the sea) landed, looking for a place to nest. After carefully
surveying the situation, and after having noted the advantages and disadvantages
of the thousands of nests she could see, she decided upon one which apparently
had just the exposure, construction and coloring that she considered most
suitable to her needs, and, waddling over to that nest, she drove off the
mother goney bird and took possession of the nest. This was quite a normal
procedure and the interest lay in what followed. The Frigate bird rolled
the goney bird's egg out of the nest, then settled down on the nest and layed
her own egg. Shortly afterwards she flew away and the poor goney mother climbed
back on the nest and draped herself over the Frigate bird's egg, presumably
hatching it in about two weeks. The cable man regretted that he did not have
time to remain in observation until the coming out party as he would have
been much interested in observing the presumably mixed emotions of the goney
mother on hatching a Frigate bird.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall one other incident during this period, which may be of interest
to you. Our three year tour of duty was drawing to a close. <A NAME="Shirley.150" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> (who,
incidentally, had become an accomplished surf boarder) came to her mother
one day and said she thought she ought to learn to dance at least one Hula
before coming home. So they went to a well known Hula teacher near the Post
and she gave Shirley the music for one Hula (on a record) together with a
sheet of instructions as to the gestures that accompanied the music. Shirley
brought them home and spent the entire afternoon practicing the Hula. Next
day she danced the Hula for the teacher, who then gave her another record
with its accompanying script. <A NAME="Shirley.158" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> practiced that Hula all afternoon and
mastered it. This process was repeated for some 15 days, Shirley learning
a new Hula each day.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The teacher gave an Exhibition of Hula dancing each year at the Royal Hawaiian
Hotel. She came to us and begged that Shirley be allowed to participate in
this Exhibition -- which was a very important one to the teacher. After much
discussion we agreed. When the night came the teacher said to the large and
strange audience: "I have been teaching the Hula for many years. During the
course of 15 lessons most students learn to dance perhaps two or three Hulas.
I have just had a pupil, Miss <A NAME="Shirley.169" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> <A NAME="Gardner.169" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>, who, in 15 lessons has learned
to dance 15 Hulas. I would not have believed this possible. She will dance
12 of these Hulas for you tonight, 9 in a group and 3 as solos. I think you
will be as enthusiastic about her as I am." As a matter of fact Shirley stole
the show and was given much enthusiastic applause, being called upon for
many encores. Personally I agreed with the audience. I have never seen anyone
dance a Hula as gracefully as Shirley did on this occasion, and I shall always
remember it with pleasure.
