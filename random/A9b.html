THE JAPANESE CADDY

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The other Japanese story was told me by General <A NAME="Abernethy.23" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> while I was his
Chief of Staff, at Headquarters, H.S.C.A.B.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He played golf regularly at the <A NAME="Oahu.27" HREF="index.html#Oahu">Oahu</A> Country Club, and always used the same
Caddy, a Japanese boy about 18 years old, who was very intelligent, and who
never failed to be on hand waiting on the days that General Abernethy played
golf. General <A NAME="Abernethy.30" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> became quite fond of the boy and enjoyed talking
to him.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
One afternoon, as the foursome was returning to the Club house to try to
make par on the 19th hole, the boy told General Abernethy that he wished
to speak to him, and when the two of them had fallen behind the others the
boy told him that that was the last time he would be able to caddy for him,
that he had just received his summons to go to <A NAME="Japan.38" HREF="index.html#Japan">Japan</A> for several years of
military service, and that he would have to leave in a few days.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
General <A NAME="Abernethy.42" HREF="index.html#Abernethy">Abernethy</A> expressed his regret and told the boy good by.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
About two days later he went out to play again and was much surprised when
he found the boy waiting, as usual, to caddy for him.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He asked him how it was that he had not left for <A NAME="Japan.49" HREF="index.html#Japan">Japan</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The boy replied: "It is the Japanese law that if a father has died his eldest
son is exempt from military service. Last week my father killed himself so
that I would not have to go."

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I think these two stories are interesting in that they illustrate some of
the perhaps conflicting characteristics of the Japanese mentality that we
Americans sometimes find it hard to understand.
