20. SUBMARINE NETS.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
On my reporting to General <A NAME="Weaver.22" HREF="index.html#Weaver">Weaver</A> he said, "The fleet is in route from <A NAME="Guantanamo.22" HREF="index.html#Guantanamo">Guantanamo</A>
to the <A NAME="York River.23" HREF="index.html#York River">York River</A> where it will concentrate. The Navy Department is greatly
concerned lest it be attacked while in route, or after concentrating, by
<A NAME="German.25" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarines. They have requested me most urgently to put down a submarine
net across the entrance to the <A NAME="Chesapeake.26" HREF="index.html#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</A> Bay by the time the Fleet arrives
there. I have told him we would do it if it could possibly be done. I want
you to do it. Can you?"

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Army had never previously had any thing to do with submarine nets. I
had never seen one, nor had I ever seen a description of one. I knew, however,
that the <A NAME="British.33" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> Navy had laid extensive nets, and I assumed that our Navy
had doubtless received reports from some of our observers relative to these
nets. I told him that I would let him know as soon as I could. I knew that
the section of Navy Ordnance that handled submarine mines also handled submarine
nets, and I hastened to confer with them. I asked if they had any reports
covering the British nets. They told me they would find out. In about an
hour they brought in a single sheet of paper, showing a rectangle with some
vertical and horizontal lines in it and with the following notation, "Net
sections 600 feet long. Depth depending on hydrographic conditions. Made
of 1/8" steel cable. This was all the information they had.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The entrance to <A NAME="Chesapeake.45" HREF="index.html#Chesapeake">Chesapeake</A> Bay is about ten miles wide. We got out some Navy
hydrographic maps and agreed upon the best location for a net. I took the
map, went to the Army and Navy Club, got a room, and spent the remainder
of the day and most of the night making up an estimate of the material which
I thought might be required to construct a net in the desired location. 

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Under the assumption that 1/2" cable (instead of 1/8") would be used, I finally
estimated that some 35000 or more clamps and sockets, of perhaps a dozen
types, and some 75 miles of 1/2" and 1" cable would be required. Next morning
I drafted a letter to the <A NAME="John.55" HREF="index.html#John">John</A> A. <A NAME="Roebling.55" HREF="index.html#Roebling">Roebling</A> Co. at Roebling, N. J., (the largest
manufacturers of wire rope), from whom I had bought considerable amounts
of marline covered wire rope for mooring mines, for the signature of the
Secretary of War, authorizing them to furnish me any material that I might
consider necessary. I called up one of the young Roeblings, whom I knew,
at Roebling, N. J., told him I would arrive on the afternoon train to purchase
a very large amount of wire rope and fittings for immediate use, and asked
him to have assembled, upon my arrival, the heads of his departments, a draftsman
and some clerks, and to have ready an Inventory Sheet showing the quantities
of wire rope and fittings on hand at <A NAME="Roebling.64" HREF="index.html#Roebling">Roebling</A> or in <A NAME="New York.64" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>. I also told
him that I must take all this material with me on the train to New York and
asked him to make arrangements for the necessary rail transportation to New York, 
and to reserve space for the shipment of all this material on the Old
<A NAME="Dominion.68" HREF="index.html#Dominion">Dominion</A> Line boat sailing next day from New York to Fort <A NAME="Monroe.68" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
When I arrived at the factory and explained the situation I was at once advised
that no fittings of the types I had listed existed in this country, and that
to provide the lengths of cable required it would be necessary to use all
the cable, irrespective of size, that could possibly be secured. After much
discussion, in which the <A NAME="Roebling.75" HREF="index.html#Roebling">Roebling</A> engineers gave all the assistance possible,
it was decided that all joints or crossings of the cable would have to be
made by siezings of galvanized wire upon which melted zinc spelter would
be poured. They removed from the factory floor all the large spelter pots
they had. We had the draftsman make a drawing of the general details of a
proposed net section, and I dictated a description of the procedure to be
followed in assembling a section (600 feet long) on shore and in placing
it in position in the net field. Copies of the Blueprints and of Mimeographed
instructions were immediately mailed to the Commanding Officer, Fort <A NAME="Monroe.83" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>,
with a letter explaining the circumstances and directing that the work be
carried on continuously until completed. The material was shipped to <A NAME="New York.85" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> 
that night and thence to Fort Monroe the next day.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
While en route to New York I had time to consider what kind of buoys might
be used to support the net sections, and I decided that 55 gallon gasoline
drums would be suitable. Upon arriving in New York I saw my bride long enough
for us to arrange for her to go up to the <A NAME="Cowdin.92" HREF="index.html#Cowdin">Cowdin</A>'s, at Mt. <A NAME="Kisco.92" HREF="index.html#Kisco">Kisco</A>, and remain
there until I could go to Fort <A NAME="Totten.93" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A>, and then I started out to secure the
number fo gasoline drums needed. It took some time to find out how to find
out how many such drums could be gotten. I was dumbfounded to learn that
the number of empty drums on hand at any one time in <A NAME="New York.96" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> was negligible
so far as my requirements were concerned.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
After considering every possibility I could think of I then decided to use
beer kegs. I had often seen, while on the street after the theater, great
trucks loaded with empty beer kegs and had no doubt but that, with all the
thirsty people in <A NAME="New York.103" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, there must be an almost unlimited quantity of
empty beer kegs awaiting somewhere to be refilled. After even more difficulty
than I had experienced in the case of the gasoline drums, I finally found
out, believe it or not, that there were never more than several hundred empty
beer kegs on hand at any one time in New York. I needed some 7000.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I had taken a room at the old downtown Army and Navy Club, and had but very
little sleep for several days. That evening I was sitting in my room, turning
the situation over in my mind. The material for the net, other than the buoys,
was on its way to Fort <A NAME="Monroe.113" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>, and I could see no possible way of securing,
in time, 7000 beer kegs. I was pretty low in spirits. There was a knock on
the door and I opened it. There stood a man, obviously a Jew, large, heavy
set, with coarse features and straight, black hair, wearing at least a No.
17 collar, with rolls of fat festooned over it. I had had occasion to observe,
in <A NAME="New York.118" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, a large number of Jews, of somewhat similar appearance, who
were obviously rolling in money from war contracts, and I sized him up as
being a typical representative of that type. He introduced himself as Mr.
<A NAME="Sultzberger.121" HREF="index.html#Sultzberger">Sultzberger</A> (or something like that), said he had come to New York on business
from his home somewhere in West <A NAME="Virginia.122" HREF="index.html#Virginia">Virginia</A>, that he was a manufacturer of beer
kegs and had just learned from one of his friends who owned a brewery that
I was very anxious to buy 7000 beer kegs.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I explained the situation to him, indicating its seriousness to the Fleet,
and told him that it was correct that I had to have 7000 beer kegs delivered
at Fort <A NAME="Monroe.129" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A> within a week. He studied quite a while and finally said,
"My factory is one of the biggest in the country. I now have a contract for
3000 beer kegs, about 2000 of which are now ready for delivery. I am working
but one relief. By increasing the size of one relief and by working three
reliefs I can deliver 3000 kegs to you tomorrow and the remaining 4000 within
a week. You can probably arrange for their shipment by express to Fort Monroe.
I will charge you the same price I am getting for my peacetime contract.
I have a boy who has volunteered for enlistment in the Army, and I would
like to do what I can to help defend the <A NAME="United States.137" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>."

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I accepted his offer at once. No man with whom I had dealings during the
War rendered more arduous, more effective, more patriotic cooperation than
did Mr. <A NAME="Sultzberger.142" HREF="index.html#Sultzberger">Sultzberger</A>. I have mentioned this incident because it shows how
easy it is to misjudge a man from initial impressions. I think also that
this may perhaps be considered as another example of that delicate balance,
between success and failure, of which I have spoken before.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
By dint of the unremitting labors of the officers and men at Fort <A NAME="Monroe.148" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>,
the net was in place in time to meet the Navy needs. This is the only instance
I know of where beer kegs became munitions of war.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Within a few days it was possible for me to go back to Fort <A NAME="Totten.153" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A>, and,
as the gate leg table had by then arrived, my bride came down from Mt. <A NAME="Kisco.154" HREF="index.html#Kisco">Kisco</A>
and I carried her across the threshold of our new home, in the traditional
manner.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The War Department shortly approved the installation of antisubmarine nets
or booms (a single heavy cable, for use in shallow water) in practically
all harbors in the <A NAME="United States.161" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> and in <A NAME="Panama.161" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A>, and I started work immediately
to effect the procurement of the new and more elaborately designed nets.
By this time, a <A NAME="British.163" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> Naval officer, who had been engaged in submarine
net work with the British <A NAME="Admiralty.164" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A>, had arrived in this country with two
complete sets of drawings of the British nets. As I recall it there were
some 200 different items involved. The Navy Department took one set and I
took the other. Each Department undertook to design its own nets.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I organized a three-man Committee, consisting of an engineer from each of
the <A NAME="Roebling.171" HREF="index.html#Roebling">Roebling</A> Co. and the U. S. Steel and Wire Co. (the two largest manufacturers
of steel rope and fittings) and myself, to meet at Ft. <A NAME="Totten.172" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A> and to design
all the fittings required, as no designs for any of them existed in this
country. It was interesting to see how that worked. After studying the <A NAME="British.174" HREF="index.html#British">British</A>
designs, they agreed that the British fittings, while doubtless satisfactory,
were very much heavier than necessary and were not well adapted to rapid
quantity production. The purpose and requirements of each fitting were analyzed;
then each engineer drew up a rough sketch of a design. After discussion another
design, upon the details of which we were all three agreed, was prepared,
and a sketch was sent to each factory, where a sample was made up by hand.
This sample was given a breakdown test to determine its weakest dimension
and a new and final design, embodying the lessons learned from all these
tests, was made, all parts made in both factories to be interchangeable.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The <A NAME="British.186" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> used two types of large buoys (between the net sections); in
water areas covered by the fire of shore batteries they used steel peg top
buoys of the type used for marking channels in the <A NAME="United States.188" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>; in water
areas beyond the range of shore guns, where a peg top steel buoy could be
sunk by enemy small arms or other fire, they used massive wooden buoys, built
up of timbers one foot square and ten feet long which were bolted together,
since such buoys could not easily be sunk by enemy fire action. I first planned
to use wooden buoys. I was surprised, however, that the total quantity of
such timbers available in the United States was probably insufficient to
meet my requirements, and the timber that would actually be used for these
buoys was then still growing in the forests of <A NAME="Washington.196" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> and <A NAME="Oregon.196" HREF="index.html#Oregon">Oregon</A>. I then
decided to use the peg top buoys. However, I found out, on inquiry, that
the peg top buoys had always been made by one manufacturer who had a small
shop on the <A NAME="Hudson.199" HREF="index.html#Hudson">Hudson</A> River, with a maximum output of 4 or 5 buoys a month.
I needed some 300. Eventually I designed a cylindrical buoy about 4 feet
in diameter and 8 feet long, which could readily be built in quantity from
standard commercial steel plates. For these buoys, the mushroom anchors designed
weighed 5000 pounds, the biggest such anchors that had ever been made in
this country. For mooring the buoys very heavy chains (one link weighed 70
pounds) were required in large quantity. I asked the six biggest manufacturers
of chain in the country to meet me in <A NAME="New York.206" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>. In this conference I learned
that no two of them used the same process for welding or the same kind of
iron. After much conferring with a large steel and iron manufacturer they
all agreed on a specification for iron that they thought all could use. I
agreed to furnish the iron. I placed a contract which took half the entire
output of the chain manufacturers of the country for three months. (Incidentally
some of them found that they were unable to use the iron thus procured, and
this caused considerable difficulty at the Depot afterwards.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
One day early in June, about the time that the design of the new nets was
completed, I received a telegram from the War Department stating that I was
to be detailed on the General Staff and ordering me to proceed to <A NAME="Washington.218" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>.
I did so. General <A NAME="Weaver.219" HREF="index.html#Weaver">Weaver</A> immediately protested to the chief of Staff that
the order had been issued without consulting him, and that my services at
the Torpedo Depot could not be spared at that time. This order was revoked
promptly and I was ordered to return to my duties at Fort <A NAME="Totten.222" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
While I was packing my bag at the Army and Navy Club, I received a telephone
call from Major <A NAME="Graves.226" HREF="index.html#Graves">Graves</A>, the Secretary of the General Staff, stating that
the Chief of Staff, General T. H. <A NAME="Bliss.227" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> (whom I had known at Fort Totten),
desired me to report to him in his office at once. I did so. He told me to
sit down. He asked me, "How soon can you leave <A NAME="Washington.229" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>?" I replied that
I could leave on the next train. He said, "Do you have a vest?" I replied
that I did. He got up, went to the door, opened it quietly and looked up
and down the hall. Then coming back to his desk, he opened a drawer, took
out a paper and rang the buzzer for the Chief Clerk. When the Clerk came
in General <A NAME="Bliss.234" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> said, "I want you to witness that I give this sealed secret
document to Captain <A NAME="Gardner.235" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>." He place the paper in a plain envelope, sealed
it with sealing wax, and handed it to me. He then said, "You will take this
envelope to <A NAME="New York.237" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>. When your train reaches <A NAME="Trenton.237" HREF="index.html#Trenton">Trenton</A> send a telegram to
Colonel So and So, Room So and So, Army Building, 39 <A NAME="Whitehall.238" HREF="index.html#Whitehall">Whitehall</A> Street, stating
when you will arrive in New York. Upon arriving report in person to him at
the Army Building and he will give you further instructions. You should know
that this paper is a very important one and that it is possible that enemy
agents may try to get possession of it." He added the suggestion that I carry
the paper in the inside pocket of my vest, and dismissed me with his good
wishes.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
This was my first (and only) experience with Cloak and Dagger stuff, and,
as I had not, at that time, had the opportunity to see any TV or Movie shows
on the subject, I didn't feel that I knew much about the methods of enemy
agents. I got another envelope, of the same size, placed several blank sheets
in it, sealed it up with sealing wax, and put it into my brief case, which
I carried with the utmost care. On the train every passenger became an object
of suspicion. When we reached <A NAME="Trenton.253" HREF="index.html#Trenton">Trenton</A> I walked through the train until I
was directly opposite the station, jumped off, ran to the telegraph office
and sent my telegram, and hastily retraced my steps to my own car. When we
arrived in <A NAME="New York.256" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> it was dark. I hurried out to the taxi stand, jumped
into the second taxi, got out on the other side, jumped into the fourth one,
and told the driver to pull out at once. When he had done so I told him to
speed up to a subway station which I knew was near the Army Building, where
I jumped out and ran to the Army Building. The offices were dark, but on
going to the designated room I found the Colonel to whom I was to report.
We took an official car and speeded to an up town hotel. We went up to an
upper floor, knocked on the door, and were admitted to a room filled with
officers. I recognized Gen. <A NAME="Sibert.264" HREF="index.html#Sibert">Sibert</A> and some other officers I knew to be on
his staff. I delivered my envelope to him and he gave me a receipt. He opened
the envelope, read the message, and said: "Please report to me on the dock
at the Port of Embarkation at <A NAME="Hoboken.267" HREF="index.html#Hoboken">Hoboken</A> tomorrow morning at eight o'clock."

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I telephoned my bride that I thought it was possible that I was going overseas
next day. When I reported to Gen. <A NAME="Sibert.271" HREF="index.html#Sibert">Sibert</A> next morning he told me that there
were three ships there which he was going to inspect to determine whether
or not they were all ready for use by embarking troops, and that he desired
that I accompany him. We spent the day inspecting these ships. When we finished
he told me to prepare a report to the Chief of Staff covering the inspection,
and to have it ready for his signature at 7 o'clock next morning. I recalled
having seen a typewriter in a room on one of the ships, and I looked for
it. When I found it I discovered that it was an old one and that the letters
on the keys were mostly worn off. I had not had occasion to use a typewriter
for several years, and I had never been at all proficient in the use of the
touch system. My report (very much like this typing -- which I am quite confident
you have long since recognized as being mine) was certainly not a model of
neat and accurate typing. Next morning General <A NAME="Sibert.283" HREF="index.html#Sibert">Sibert</A> and I met an incoming
train at 7:30 and General <A NAME="Bliss.284" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> himself got off. General Sibert thanked me
and told me that was all for me.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I had brought him the final orders for the first movement of U. S. troops
to <A NAME="France.289" HREF="index.html#France">France</A>, and they were embarked during the day -- without me.
