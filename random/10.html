10. In the Field Artillery <BR>

Upon arriving
at Fort <A NAME="Sam Houston.20" HREF="index.html#Sam Houston">Sam Houston</A>, two 1903 men, <A NAME="Clifford.20" HREF="index.html#Clifford">Clifford</A> <A NAME="Jones.20" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A> and <A NAME="Ellery.20" HREF="index.html#Ellery">Ellery</A> <A NAME="Farmer.20" HREF="index.html#Farmer">Farmer</A>, who
occupied a set of quarters, invited me to live with them, which I was very
glad to do.<P>Captain <A NAME="Ernest.22" HREF="index.html#Ernest">Ernest</A> Hinds, my Captain, was on a Board in <A NAME="Washington.22" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>,
developing a system of Fire Control for use with the new Rapid Fire Field
Guns (3") to replace the old 3.2" non-recoil guns with which the Field Artillery
was equipped. There were, in the Battery, two rather old 1st Lieutenants
(they had come in from the Volunteers, in '98). They were both good officers,
but at the time they happened not to be on speaking terms (their wives had
had some argument about a maid) and they were quite content to have me take
over as many of the routine duties as possible.<P>I have always remembered
my first command assignment. A few days after I had reported for duty I was
told to take charge of a mounted drill for recruits to be held on the plain
(now the site of the new Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.32" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>) that afternoon. At the proper
time I rode over to the plain. I observed about a dozen recruits being put
through their drill by Sergeant <A NAME="Robbins.34" HREF="index.html#Robbins">Robbins</A>. He was old enough to be my grandfather
and he had probably been drilling recruits since before I was born. He seemed
to be doing a very good job, and I watched from a distance for some time.
It seemed to me that, if I was in charge of the drill, it was desirable,
as a matter of prestige for a new 2nd Lieutenant, that I do something to
show the recruits that I at least knew the drill. So I watched it carefully
for a while. Sgt. Robbins began explaining a new drill movement to them.
I thought I remembered my Drill Regulations from <A NAME="West Point.41" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, and I heard
him make what I was sure was a mistake. So I rode up and said, "Sergeant,
I think the Regulations prescribe so and so instead of so and so as you have
said." He looked at me with some astonishment, and the recruits seemed to
enjoy having him put in his place, be the new 2nd Lieutenant. He said, "I
am quite sure that the Regulations state (the way he had explained it), Sir.
But if the Lieutenant says it's the other way that's the way I'll do it."
I rode back to my quarters feeling quite well pleased with myself. When I
got home it occurred to me that, just to be sure, I had better check up on
the Drill Regulations. I found that the Sergeant had been right and I had
been wrong. I was faced with one of the most difficult problems that I had
ever been confronted with, and I didn't sleep much that night, turning it
over in my mind and trying to decide what I should do. Next afternoon I rode
out to the drill grounds again and, after I had watched the drill for a while,
I rode up to the detail. The Sergeant called them to attention and I said,
"Sergeant <A NAME="Robbins.56" HREF="index.html#Robbins">Robbins</A>, yesterday I told you that you had made a mistake in explaining
a command. I have looked up the Regulations and I find that I was entirely
wrong and that you were entirely right about it. So hereafter you do it the
way you explained it yesterday." The recruits looked at the Sergeant with
obvious admiration and respect for his knowledge. The Sergeant looked at
me, with a somewhat paternal smile, and said, "Thank you, Lieutenant." During
the three years that I remained with the 2nd Battery, Sergeant Robbins, and
the other sergeants, by their friendly advice and tactful suggestions, saved
me from many mistakes which otherwise could have been very embarrassing to
me. I learned a great deal from them -- about many things besides the Drill
Regulations.<P>I was stationed at Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.66" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> for about a year. During
this time the Battery went up to <A NAME="Kerrville.67" HREF="index.html#Kerrville">Kerrville</A>, <A NAME="Texas.67" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>, for target practice and
went to <A NAME="Dallas.68" HREF="index.html#Dallas">Dallas</A> for a County Fair. 1st Lieutenant E. A. <A NAME="Stuart.68" HREF="index.html#Stuart">Stuart</A> (in command)
and his wife had come from Dallas, and Mrs. Stuart promised to make the stay
in Dallas an enjoyable one for all concerned. We arranged to have <A NAME="Clifford.70" HREF="index.html#Clifford">Clifford</A>
<A NAME="Jones.71" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A>, also a 2nd Lieutenant, attached to the Battery for the trip, and he
and I certainly had a most enjoyable time. One of Mrs. Stuart's friends,
Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Green, who had a large and attractive home, arranged a
House Party with three or four girls (about the prettiest quartette I ever
saw) as house guests, and Jones and I spent most of our time there. (Jones
and <A NAME="Besse.76" HREF="index.html#Besse">Besse</A> Green fell in love and were married within a year.)
