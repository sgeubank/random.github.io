32. ASSISTANT COMMANDANT, COAST ARTILLERY SCHOOL, FORT MONROE, VA.

<HR align=left>


<P>
Upon the completion of my three year tour in <A NAME="Hawaii.22" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>, I was relieved from
duty in the Hawaiian Department about <A NAME="March.23" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> 23, 1935, and ordered to report
to the Commandant, Coast Artillery School, for duty as Assistant Commandant.
During the three years that I remained on this duty, first under Brigadier
General <A NAME="Joseph.26" HREF="index.html#Joseph">Joseph</A> P. <A NAME="Tracy.26" HREF="index.html#Tracy">Tracy</A> and later under Brigadier General <A NAME="John.26" HREF="index.html#John">John</A> W. <A NAME="Gulick.26" HREF="index.html#Gulick">Gulick</A>,
I was given complete freedom of action in the running of the school, and
I found the work to be most interesting. I instituted a system of weekly
conferences in each of which four or five students were required to give
a short talk on an assigned subject, generally the current political, economic
and international problems and relationships of the various countries of
the world (using references that I had spent much time and labor in preparing),
and I was fortunate enough to be able to get Dr. <A NAME="Douglas.33" HREF="index.html#Douglas">Douglas</A> R. <A NAME="Freeman.33" HREF="index.html#Freeman">Freeman</A> to come
down from <A NAME="Richmond.34" HREF="index.html#Richmond">Richmond</A> and give a series of talks on current events. I also sought,
in the Artillery instruction, to indoctrinate the student officers with some
of the lessons that I had learned during my service in <A NAME="Panama.36" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> and <A NAME="Hawaii.36" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>.

<P>
I had been promoted to Colonel on June 1st, 1935, and we lived in one of
the two fine quarters on the water front near the light house, which we enjoyed
greatly. I recall particularly that, on the 20th anniversary of our wedding
(April 14th, 1937), with the assistance of a number of the ladies of the
Post, I staged a big surprise party for your grandmother which was really
quite a surprise for her.

<P>
I also recall quite distinctly an incident that occurred during this period.
We had some 30 or 40 horses assigned to the School (for the exercise of the
students) and we had, each year, a Horse Show for officers and their families.
Since there was considerable disparity in the qualifications of the horses,
they were, for the show, assigned by lot to riders, generally several riders
being assigned to each horse. At the time <A NAME="Shirley.52" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> (then a student at <A NAME="Ashley.52" HREF="index.html#Ashley">Ashley</A>
Hall) was at home during her vacation, and she entered the Horse Show. She
drew <A NAME="Homer.54" HREF="index.html#Homer">Homer</A> Case, a fractious horse but an excellent jumper if he wanted to
jump. The Show took place in an enclosed ring containing six or eight jumps
of various kinds.

<P>
When the time came for Homer Case to enter the ring he was being ridden by
an officer who prided himself on his horsemanship. As he approached the entrance
to the ring <A NAME="Homer.61" HREF="index.html#Homer">Homer</A> Case reared several times, and upon entering the ring he
charged directly across it, and, jumping the enclosing fence (and policing
his rider), he ran off the field. An enlisted man ran after him and brought
him back in a very excited state of mind. <A NAME="Shirley.64" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> was scheduled to mount
him next. She went up to him, spoke to him quietly, patted his neck, mounted
him, entered the ring and took every jump perfectly. She won the First Prize
-- much to our satisfaction if not to that of the previous rider. This was
also much to the satisfaction and edification of the four young M.I.T. ROTC
students who were sitting in our box.

<P>
I have never seen a more impressive demonstration of horsemanship, and I
shall always remember it with pleasure and satisfaction.

<P>
General <A NAME="Gulick.76" HREF="index.html#Gulick">Gulick</A> had been a good friend of mine ever since I was a student
officer under him in 1910. He had been Chief of Coast Artillery (and one
of the best ones we ever had) as a Major General and had become a very influential
officer. In the Fall of 1937 he had been on a board of General Officers convened
by the Chief of Staff, Gen. <A NAME="Malin.80" HREF="index.html#Malin">Malin</A> <A NAME="Craig.80" HREF="index.html#Craig">Craig</A>, to make up an Eligible List of colonels
for promotion to Brigadier General. On his return to Fort <A NAME="Monroe.81" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A> he came
into my office and said "Young man, you have got to get away from here and
get command duty as soon as possible. General Craig informed our Board that
he regards no colonel as eligible for promotion who has not demonstrated
his qualifications as a commander by actual command of troops. If you have
not done this you will not be considered for promotion as long as General
<A NAME="Craig.87" HREF="index.html#Craig">Craig</A> is Chief of Staff. You must, as soon as possible, get command of a
post where the Commander is confronted with the most difficult problems and
demonstrate that you can handle them. I think Fort <A NAME="Hancock.89" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A> is such a post,
and I believe you should go there as soon as possible. What do you think
about it?"

<P>
I assured him that I agreed with him. He said, "I thought you would, and
I have already arranged for you to be ordered there within a week or so."
(This action of General <A NAME="Gulick.96" HREF="index.html#Gulick">Gulick</A> was a most generous one, as my being relieved
from duty as Assistant Commandant necessarily greatly increased the amount
of work devolving upon him. I have always remembered it with grateful appreciation.)
