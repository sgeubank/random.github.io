36. IN COMMAND OF CAMP HAAN

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I had been promoted to Major General (temporary) on October 26, 1940.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon the completion of my three year tour in <A NAME="Hawaii.25" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>, I was ordered to take
command of Camp <A NAME="Haan.26" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A>, at <A NAME="Riverside.26" HREF="index.html#Riverside">Riverside</A>, <A NAME="California.26" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>, the <A NAME="Pacific.26" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> Coast Antiaircraft
Artillery Training Center. We arrived there on October 16, 1941.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
There were two Brigades in the Camp, one (the 37th) from the Regular Army
and the other (the 101st) from the National Guard. The field training was,
in large part, conducted at Camp <A NAME="Maar.32" HREF="index.html#Maar">Maar</A>, in the <A NAME="Mojave.32" HREF="index.html#Mojave">Mojave</A> Desert, and much of
our effort was directed toward the establishment and building up of this
camp.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During this period some officials from Cal Tech came down to see me. They
were just beginning to conduct some experiments as to the practicability
fo firing rockets from artillery guns, and they asked if I would cooperate
with them by having one of our AA batteries do some test firings at Camp
<A NAME="Maar.41" HREF="index.html#Maar">Maar</A>. I was glad to do so, and such firings were carried on for several months,
during which time I had several conferences at Cal Tech with Dr. <A NAME="Millikin.42" HREF="index.html#Millikin">Millikin</A>
and others of the faculty. So far as I know these were the first rockets
made and fired in this country.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Fighter Command was stationed at <A NAME="March.47" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> Field (across the road from Camp
<A NAME="Haan.48" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A>), and in November the Commanding General, March Field, and I agreed,
with the approval of the Commanding General Western Defense Command, to have
a Joint Air Corps - AA Artillery Exercise at <A NAME="San Francisco.50" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> and <A NAME="Los Angeles.50" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A>.
I was anxious to do this as no one in this country had ever attempted to
locate an AA defense in a large city, and there were many problems as to
how and where to locate the guns and searchlights (we did not even know what
installations existed that needed AA protection), and as to how to establish
the necessary communications system, to store the ammunition, and to provide
quarters and shelter for the troops required for the AA defense of a large
city.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Brigade Commanders and certain of their staff officers were sent to San
Francisco (101st Brigade) and to <A NAME="Los Angeles.61" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A> (37th Brigade) to survey the
situation and secure the answers to the problems that had to be met.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
We had received but little information about the Japanese situation, but
I felt that it might not only be a valuable experience to take along the
normal amount of AA ammunition, but that if we were to go to the trouble
and expense of moving the two Brigades from Camp <A NAME="Haan.68" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A> to <A NAME="San Francisco.68" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> and
<A NAME="Los Angeles.69" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A>, and installing in each of these cities an AA defense, it would
seem reasonable that, under the existing conditions, this defense should
be actually capable of instant action, if required, at any time. Headquarters
Western Defence Command disapproved the carrying of the ammunition, but after
a personal talk with General <A NAME="DeWitt.73" HREF="index.html#DeWitt">DeWitt</A>, The Western Defense Commander, he authorized
it.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Thus, by a remarkable coincidence, when the attack on <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.77" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A> occurred
on December 7th, 1941, all the AA units west of the Rocky Mountains were
actually in position, ready for action, in <A NAME="San Francisco.79" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> and <A NAME="Los Angeles.79" HREF="index.html#Los Angeles">Los Angeles</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The War Department at once ordered all the AA materiel in the hands of most
of the AA organizations in the <A NAME="United States.83" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> to be shipped, at the earliest
practicable date, to the <A NAME="Pacific.84" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> Coast. The necessity for speed was so emphasized
that guns, Fire Control equipment, searchlights, sound locators, and all
other AA materiel on hand were loaded onto box cars, flat cars, or any other
types of cars immediately available, which started moving westward, with
the understanding that the destination of the equipment would be determined
and communicated to the railroads while the cars were in route. As a matter
of fact, no plans existed as to what installations on the coast required
AA defense, or as to the kinds and amounts of the materiel required at any
locality.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
At the same time orders were issued for two National Guard Brigades to be
organized from troops available and to be sent as soon as possible to the
<A NAME="Pacific.97" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> Coast, one (the 39th) to <A NAME="Seattle.97" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A> and the other (the 33rd) to <A NAME="San Diego.97" HREF="index.html#San Diego">San Diego</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As the various shipments of materiel moved westward they were gradually combined
into long trains. Headquarters Western Defense Command had to make a quick
decision as to where these trains should be routed to. They decided to send
all of them to Camp <A NAME="Haan.103" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A> pending such time as a decision could be made as
to the ultimate destination of the equipment. Accordingly the trains of loaded
cars began pulling into Camp Haan. It was impossible to determine the point
of origin of any individual car or to determine its contents without actually
unloading it. No Ordnance Invoices or similar papers were ever received.
and so far as I know none were ever prepared. (I have often wondered how
The Ordnance property returns were ever settled up.) Much of the equipment
was in an unserviceable or incomplete condition and all our efforts were
devoted to overhauling and repairing it in the Ordnance Shop and in getting
it assembled into tactical units preparatory to shipment to such points as
might later be prescribed by Headquarters WD Command.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During the time that I was in command of Camp <A NAME="Haan.116" HREF="index.html#Haan">Haan</A>, and for some months afterwards
we lived in a very attractive house on <A NAME="Ribadoux.117" HREF="index.html#Ribadoux">Ribadoux</A> Drive, <A NAME="Riverside.117" HREF="index.html#Riverside">Riverside</A>, <A NAME="California.117" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>.
