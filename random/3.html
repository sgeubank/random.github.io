3. Recollections of My Father and Mother <BR>
His Youth
</H3>
<HR align=left>
My grandfather, Wm. <A NAME="Gardner.19" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>, was accidentally killed while felling a tree
on his farm when my father was a boy about ten years old. The responsibility
for the support of the family thus devolved upon him at an early age. Being
only 16 at the end of the Civil War he never actually joined the <A NAME="Confederate.22" HREF="index.html#Confederate">Confederate</A>
army, although as a boy he participated in the activities of a local Law
and Order organization. During the War living conditions for the family were
very difficult; practically all items of food and clothing had to be limited
to what could be produced on the farm.<P>The future outlook was most discouraging.
My father was determined that his sisters and he should receive the best
education possible, and it was already his ambition to become a doctor. He
saw little prospect of realizing these these objectives while living on a
small and none too good farm in <A NAME="Daviston.30" HREF="index.html#Daviston">Daviston</A>, <A NAME="Alabama.30" HREF="index.html#Alabama">Alabama</A>. Several of his uncles
lived in <A NAME="Mississippi.31" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A>, where they were reasonably prosperous farmers and they
urged my grandmother to move to Mississippi and to settle down near them.
After much serious consideration it was finally decided to do so. With only
such items of clothing, cooking utensils and furniture as could be carried
with them, the family made the move in an ox-drawn wagon driven by my father,
then perhaps seventeen years old. After an arduous trip, the difficulties
of which you can hardly appreciate in these days of automobiles and good
roads, the family finally arrived at their destination, and my father bought,
on time, a farm near <A NAME="Oxford.39" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>, Miss., where the University of <A NAME="Mississippi.39" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> was
located. For the next fifteen years father, whose previous education had
been limited to that in a small country school in <A NAME="Alabama.41" HREF="index.html#Alabama">Alabama</A>, by incessant labor
and firm determination, was able to make enough from the farm and from teaching
a small country school himself during the winters, to give his sisters a
good education as determined by the standards of that time.<P>He became acquainted,
during this time, with Dr. <A NAME="Isom.45" HREF="index.html#Isom">Isom</A>, one of the most prominent physicians in
the state, who encouraged him to study medicine. Father spent several years
as a student at the University, preparing himself to attend a Medical College,
at the same time carrying on the farm and reading medicine in Dr. Isom's
office. While a student at the University he became acquainted with another
student, <A NAME="Adair.50" HREF="index.html#Adair">Adair</A> <A NAME="Skipwith.50" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>, with whom he formed what became a lifelong friendship,
and of which I shall have more to say later.
