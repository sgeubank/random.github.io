34. PROMOTION TO BRIGADIER GENERAL.

</H3>
<HR>


<P>
On May 1, 1938, I was promoted to Brigadier General. I was ordered to proceed
to <A NAME="Washington.23" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> to prepare plans for a combined Air Corps -- Antiaircraft Artillery
Exercise, at Fort <A NAME="Bragg.24" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A>, <A NAME="North Carolina.24" HREF="index.html#North Carolina">North Carolina</A>, to be held in October, and to be
preceded by a month's AA firings, to be held in September, in both of which
I was to be in command. For those Exercises practically all the Air Corps'
Bombers and Fighters were to be made available and all the AA Artillery units
of the Regular Army east of the Rocky Mountains were to participate. The
Joint Exercise consisted of a ten day period throughout which the Air Corps
was free to attack Fort Bragg at any time, over a sector consisting of 39
of the eastern counties of <A NAME="North Carolina.31" HREF="index.html#North Carolina">North Carolina</A> extending from the coast line and
converging at Fort <A NAME="Bragg.32" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A> (about 250 miles wide at the coast and 150 miles
deep).

<P>
The War Department directive prescribed that I was to establish a Warning
Net, utilizing as observers Reserve officers to be called to active duty
for this purpose.

<P>
After a busy month, in which, after frequent consultations with the offices
of the Chief of Coast Artillery and the Chief of the Air Corps, a staff was
selected, a program for the firings was prepared (including provision for
a large Record Section to analyze and prepare reports on practically daily
firings), agreement was arrived at with the Air Corps as to the strength
of Fighter planes to be assigned to my command, and as to other matters designed
to make the Exercise as realistic as possible.

<P>
I was then ordered to <A NAME="Atlanta.50" HREF="index.html#Atlanta">Atlanta</A>, where I arrived June 6, 1938, to command the
South <A NAME="Atlantic.51" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A> Coast Artillery District, this being really little more than
a paper assignment to permit me to participate in the Exercises at Fort <A NAME="Bragg.52" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A>.

<P>
After several weeks, spent partly in conferences with the Corps Area staff
as to the details of ordering Reserve officers to active duty, accompanied
by Lieut. <A NAME="Milan.57" HREF="index.html#Milan">Milan</A> <A NAME="Weber.57" HREF="index.html#Weber">Weber</A>, whom I had selected as Aide (and who continued as
my Aide until 1943) I went to Fort Bragg and began to make active preparations
for the Exercises. It soon became evident that, due to the marshy and sparsely
settled nature of eastern <A NAME="North Carolina.60" HREF="index.html#North Carolina">North Carolina</A>, it would be entirely impracticable
to secure sufficient Reserve officers to constitute a Warning Net.

<P>
In all previous Joint Air Corps - AA Artillery Exercises there had been little
more than a few Field telephones, manned by enlisted men, to constitute a
Warning Net.

<P>
After a careful study of the matter I decided that any really effective Warning
Net that could be established must necessarily cover a large area and be
manned by civilian observers. I decided to divide the sectors into squares,
six miles on a side, with a commercial telephone near the center of each
square, and found that some 300 observation posts, manned by about 1800 volunteer
civilians as observers, would be required.

<P>
In order to make such an extensive plan effective it would be necessary to
develop state wide interest and support for the undertaking. This involved
visiting the Governor, the Adjutant General, and other officials, getting
them to issue Proclamations setting forth the purpose of the Exercise and
urging full cooperation by all the people of the state. We got the American
Legion (which was well organized and popular in the state) to sponsor the
Exercises and I visited practically every city and town of importance in
the area and made talks to the assembled civic clubs.

<P>
The area was divided into six subareas (corresponding to the territorial
organization of the American Legion) and the local Legion Commander was put
in charge of securing the necessary civilian volunteer observers.

<P>
In a conference of several hours duration with the <A NAME="President.92" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Carolina
Telephone Company and his Directors, it developed that there were 15 independent
telephone companies in the area of the Exercise. He agreed to undertake the
task of coordinating their efforts, training the operators, and making such
additional telephone installations as might be required in order to enable
any observer to report to Fort <A NAME="Bragg.97" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A> in 30 seconds. The only compensation
would be the normal commercial charges for the messages sent. He carried
this program out in every respect, and was largely responsible for the success
of the Exercise. (I learned afterwards that his company had spent some $6000
more than it received, but he never mentioned the matter to me.)

<P>
The observers, using a very simple form of message, stated only the number
of planes (many or few) observed, whether flying low or high, and the time
observed. This information was found to be sufficient to enable the Fighter
Commander to plot the course of the attacking planes and to determine in
general the type of planes involved.

<P>
At this time the Air Corps was primarily interested in Bombers and considered
the Fighters to be almost obsolete. Major <A NAME="Kepner.112" HREF="index.html#Kepner">Kepner</A> (a former Balloon man) was
assigned to command the Fighters, and we agreed that we would do everything
possible to enable the Fighters to demonstrate their usefulness.

<P>
To our great satisfaction the Exercises were a great success. Throughout
the ten day period the Bombers attacked frequently, by day and by night,
under all sorts of weather conditions, and in every case the attacking planes
were tracked by the observers and were intercepted by the Fighters. This
made quite an impression on the considerable number of high ranking officers
who were present. These included General <A NAME="Andrews.122" HREF="index.html#Andrews">Andrews</A>, the Chief of the Air Corps,
who stated to me that, as the result of the Exercise, the Air Corps would
have to modify materially its previous ideas as to the relative ineffectiveness
of both Fighters and terrestrial observers manning a Warning Net.

<P>
I had planned to blackout the Fort <A NAME="Bragg.128" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A> area on the last night of the Exercise.
Word of this was passed around, and the interest was so great that on the
night in question some 66 cities and towns, covering over 20000 square miles,
and with a population of about 750000 people, volunteered and, at their own
request, joined in to establish, I believe, the first large blackout ever
used in the <A NAME="United States.133" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>.

<P>
While at Fort <A NAME="Bragg.136" HREF="index.html#Bragg">Bragg</A> I received orders to proceed to <A NAME="Hawaii.136" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A> for duty as Commanding
General, Hawaiian Separate Coast Artillery Brigade. I was able to take a
short leave, which I spent in <A NAME="Summerville.138" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A>.

<P>
The day before I arrived there Mrs. <A NAME="Haight.141" HREF="index.html#Haight">Haight</A> had an obstruction in the lower
bowel. Three surgeons from <A NAME="Charleston.142" HREF="index.html#Charleston">Charleston</A> were called in consultation by Dr.
<A NAME="Louis.143" HREF="index.html#Louis">Louis</A> <A NAME="Miles.143" HREF="index.html#Miles">Miles</A>, and they decided that an operation was necessary. They found
that a thrombosis in a large blood vessel had occurred, which had caused
a gangrenous condition to develop in the intestine.

<P>
She died on the day after the operation, on November 8, 1938. The body was
cremated and later buried in the <A NAME="Haight.149" HREF="index.html#Haight">Haight</A> lot in the Oak <A NAME="Grove.149" HREF="index.html#Grove">Grove</A> Cemetery in
<A NAME="Fall River.150" HREF="index.html#Fall River">Fall River</A>, <A NAME="Mass.150" HREF="index.html#Mass">Mass</A>.
