We remained in <A NAME="Oxford.18" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A> for three or four
years. At that time <A NAME="Mississippi.19" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> was undergoing a serious period. Much of
the farm land was poor, and without slaves it had become quite impracticable
to operate many of the farms at a profit. Grandfather <A NAME="Goolsby.21" HREF="index.html#Goolsby">Goolsby</A> had let several
of them revert to the State, since he couldn't rent them for enough to pay
the taxes, and many others had done the same. The feeling was becoming widespread
that Mississippi was about worn out, that it could not regain prosperity
in the foreseeable future, and that the time had come to move to new country
with greater prospects for the future. Three places were given chief consideration:
<A NAME="Seattle.27" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A>, <A NAME="Washington.27" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>; Fort <A NAME="Smith.27" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>, <A NAME="Arkansas.27" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A>; and <A NAME="Texas.27" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>. Ft. Smith was considered
because it adjoined the vast and rich <A NAME="Indian.28" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A> Territory, which was rapidly
developing and which afforded excellent prospects particularly for wholesale
dealers located in Ft. Smith. A group of about half a dozen prominent men
of <A NAME="Oxford.31" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>, mostly friends and patients of father's, decided to move their
families together to Ft. Smith and they persuaded father to join with them.
They made the move together by train in about 1887, and they all went into
business there. For at least a generation afterward this group of Mississippians
played a prominent part in the affairs of Ft. <A NAME="Smith.35" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>. Father practiced medicine
there for 35 or more years, until shortly before his death in 1924. He established
a reputation as a gynecologist and obstetrician, which resulted in his being
called in consultation in difficult cases in many adjacent towns in <A NAME="Oklahoma.38" HREF="index.html#Oklahoma">Oklahoma</A>
(the old <A NAME="Indian.39" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A> Territory) and <A NAME="Arkansas.39" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A>.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I recall once driving with him
by a house in the outskirts of town, on the porch of which stood a poorly
dressed woman and a small child, and he remarked, "I was called in to attend
that woman in childbirth when the attending physician had given her up as
a hopeless case. You see the child standing there with her." After a few
moments silence he said, "During my life it has been my good fortune to be
able, in many similar cases, to save the lives of either a mother or a child
or both, which, without my interposition, would have been lost. That is the
greatest satisfaction I have gotten out of life." In this particular case
the family was so poor that he never submitted a bill. I am sure that during
most of his life at least a fourth of the work that he did was never even
entered on his books, because the family couldn't afford to pay for it.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Although
he had, I believe, the best practice in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.51" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>, without doubt, it was
a very rare thing that, when all the bills were paid at the end of the month,
there remained in the bank any appreciable balance, although we lived a most
simple and economical life. Perhaps the fact that the regular price, in those
days, of a house visit was $2.00 and of an office visit and prescription
$1.00, as compared with 5-10 and 3-5 dollars, respectively, today, had something
to do with this.<P ALIGN=LEFT>A few years after we moved to Ft. Smith Father was elected
<A NAME="Alderman.58" HREF="index.html#Alderman">Alderman</A> in the City Council, from our ward. The city government, at that
time, was in some disrepute (as was probably the case in most cities). The
2nd ward contained a number of the most prominent businessmen in the city,
and they had urged father to run for Alderman and to do what he could to
correct the trouble. In those days the street lights were arc lights, and
the local Power Company had, for some years, had the contract for supplying
the power for these lights at $100 or more per light per year. At the time
father joined the Council this contract was due to come up for renewal in
a few months. He knew nothing about electric lighting, but something he observed
excited his suspicions about this contract. He set to work to make a study
of the cost of municipal lighting plants. He bought what periodicals he could
that dealt with the subject and wrote to a number of cities where studies
had been made of the matter and had led to the installation of municipal
lighting plants and obtained copies of these studies. After a careful study
and analysis of all the data available, and considering that Ft. <A NAME="Smith.72" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> had
available readily an unlimited supply of fine coal at a cost much less than
in most cities, he concluded that the price in the contract was excessive
and that a reduction of 50% would still leave a reasonable profit for the
Electric Light and Power Company, and he determined to fight, in every way
possible, for such a reduction when the matter of renewing the contract came
up. The proponents of renewing the old contract learned of his investigation
and became quite concerned about it.<P ALIGN=LEFT>A few weeks before the matter was
to come up for a vote several prominent men, all patients of father's, came
to his office, and one of them said, "Doctor, we are all good friends and
good patients of yours and we are beginning to worry some about your health.
You look tired. And we know that you haven't had a rest or a vacation in
ten years, and we have decided that the time has come when it is essential
to your good health that you take a vacation. We are so anxious for you to
do so that we would like very much to send you and your wife on a trip around
the world at our expense." Father had been looking over the members of the
delegation while the spokesman was speaking, and he at once noted that while
they were all good patients of his they were also stockholders in the Electric
Light and Power Company. With a smile which, I imagine, would have done credit
to the <A NAME="Mona.91" HREF="index.html#Mona">Mona</A> <A NAME="Lisa.91" HREF="index.html#Lisa">Lisa</A> (or to <A NAME="Perry.91" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A> <A NAME="Mason.91" HREF="index.html#Mason">Mason</A>) he assured the group that he appreciated
their thoughtfulness and consideration but that he regretted that he could
not possibly leave town at that time. When the matter came up in the Council
his presentation of the case was so convincing that public opinion forced
the renewal of the contract at the substantially reduced rate that he had
recommended, thus resulting in a considerable reduction in the city expenses.
I mention this incident because of its bearing on another incident 15 or
20 years afterwards, which I shall tell you about later when I come to it.<P ALIGN=LEFT>For
some years father was <A NAME="President.99" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Medical Examining Board, which examined
applicants for a license to practice medicine. One day there walked into
his office a young man, roughly dressed, in a flannel shirt, with his trousers
in his boots, but with an intelligent looking face. He introduced himself
and said, "I would like to be examined for a license to practice medicine."
Having noted, with some disfavor, his general appearance, father asked him,
"What do you know about medicine?" The young man looked him straight in the
eye and replied, "Well, Sir, it is my understanding that that is what you
are here to find out." It was the custom of the Board for each member to
give an applicant an oral examination in certain subjects. Father, being
somewhat taken aback by the apparent cockiness of the young man, made an
appointment with him for an examination at an early date. At that time the
young man produced a diploma from the <A NAME="Johns.111" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.111" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> Medical School (one of
the very best in the country) and father proceeded to ask him the questions
that he usually asked applicants. The man answered every one of them correctly
and concisely. Father decided that the applicant was still a little too cocky
and he decided to take him down a bit. He had just purchased and carefully
studied a new medical book covering the latest theory and practice of gynecology.
The book had contained a full discussion on, as I remember it, the probable
benefit to be derived in certain cases of cutting some nerve, which father
had found very interesting, and he asked the young man casually to discuss
this matter. He answered, without hesitation, "That is a difficult question
for me to answer definitely. So and so of <A NAME="Vienna.121" HREF="index.html#Vienna">Vienna</A> says so and so; So and so
of <A NAME="London.122" HREF="index.html#London">London</A> says so and so; So and so of <A NAME="Johns.122" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.122" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> says so and so. I do
not know which of them is correct." This led to a lengthy discussion which
proved much more enlightening to father than the book he had thought to be
the last word on the subject. He told the young man to report to the other
members of the Board for their examination and then to return to him. He
questioned each of the examiners as to the result of his examination and
they all concurred that the candidate had made an almost perfect score. When
the applicant returned to the office, father told him to sit down, and said,
"Here is your license to practice medicine. And I do not hesitate to tell
you that you are the best qualified young doctor that I have ever had occasion
to examine. Now who in the hell are you?" The young man smiled, and, after
a moment's thought, told his story. The name he had given was an assumed
one. His real name was So and so. His father was a prominent and wealthy
man in <A NAME="Memphis.135" HREF="index.html#Memphis">Memphis</A> <A NAME="Tennessee.135" HREF="index.html#Tennessee">Tennessee</A>. From boyhood he had planned to study medicine,
and his father had gladly given him every thing in the nature of an education
that he could desire. He had graduated from one of our leading Universities,
had graduated medicine from <A NAME="Johns.138" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.138" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> and had<P ALIGN=LEFT>interned there for several
years, had then spent three years studying in <A NAME="Vienna.139" HREF="index.html#Vienna">Vienna</A> and in Germany under
some of the most famous medical authorities, and had then come back to Memphis
to begin practice. Shortly after his arrival there he had had a quarrel with
a man whom he had shot and killed. The circumstances were such that his lawyer,
an old family friend, had advised him to leave <A NAME="Memphis.143" HREF="index.html#Memphis">Memphis</A>, for some unknown
destination, and to live there, under an assumed name, for years if necessary.
He had come to <A NAME="Oklahoma.145" HREF="index.html#Oklahoma">Oklahoma</A> and had been offered the position of physician to
one of the big coal mines, at a salary of $500 a month (which was a lot of
money in those days) which he desired to accept. Father felt considerable
sympathy for the young man and gave him what help and encouragement he could.
He knew that the mine was located in a very rough mining community, in which
it was unlikely that the young doctor would find any congenial associates,
and he could not but wonder somewhat as to what the future might have in
store for him. Father received a few letters from him, but in a few months
they ceased. Several months later he learned the reason. The young doctor,
in his loneliness, had married the pretty but ignorant waitress in the Lunch
Room where he got his meals. A couple of months later he had killed himself.<P ALIGN=LEFT>At
the time of his retirement from his practice father had, for many years,
been Chief of Staff of the Hospital (the only one in the city). It consisted
of a large former private residence which, with some alterations, had been
converted into a hospital. Its bed capacity was quite inadequate to meet
normal needs. This was shown clearly at the time of the tornado, in about
1898. It was a hot, sultry summer evening, with a stillness that was oppressive.
At about 11 p.m. it suddenly began to hail and then to rain, and in a few
minutes the wind reached tornado strength, and for a few minutes our house
was on the verge of collapsing, after which the wind gradually died down.
The electric lights and the telephone had gone out. Father, realizing the
nature of the emergency, hurried down the few blocks to <A NAME="Garrison.166" HREF="index.html#Garrison">Garrison</A> Avenue,
the main business street, and I went with him. We found out that the tornado
had passed across the center of the city, levelling with the ground practically
all buildings in a path about a block wide. Some of them had caught on fire,
and the Firemen had turned their hoses on the flaming ruins. We could hear
the screams of some of those who, having first been seriously injured by
the collapse of the building, had been pinned under the wreckage, then burned
seriously by the fire and finally drowned by the water. A few bodies had
been brought out of the ruins and were being sent to the morgue. (I saw over
a hundred bodies in it before morning.) It was not possible to find out the
extent of the damage as the telephones were mostly out of service. Father
directed me to run to the Hospital and tell the Head nurse to take steps
to set up every bed or cot that could be set up in the building (including
the stairs) and to prepare to handle perhaps several hundred injured patients.
I recall that she seemed to think that, in my excitement, I was greatly exaggerating
the seriousness of the tornado, and then she seemed to be quite doubtful
about the need of such an all out effort as I had indicated. By morning every
possible space in the hospital, including the halls and the stairs, was occupied
by injured. Approximately 125 people were killed, many of whom I knew. This
was the first, and the last, tornado that ever struck Ft. <A NAME="Smith.185" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>, or that
I have ever witnessed, and I hope that I shall never see another one.<P ALIGN=LEFT>There
were many queer, and to us inexplicable, things that happened during this
tornado. One that I recall particularly was that it seemed to bounce up and
down. Thus it flattened out a small store in its path, just across the street
from the new High School, bounced over the School building and levelled to
the ground all the buildings in the block of residences just beyond the School
building. The damage to the High School was due chiefly to the fact that
two large and heavy chimney tops above its roof were toppled over, falling
down through the building to the basement. I happen to remember this particularly
as one of these chimneys fell on top of my desk in the study hall. Had the
tornado arrived at 11 o'clock a.m. instead of at 11 o'clock p.m. I would
probably not have remembered it so well.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Father had, for some years, been
trying in every way possible to find a way to build a new and adequate hospital,
but he had not been able to develop sufficient public interest in the matter
to make much headway. The tornado served to focus interest on the need for
a modern hospital of the capacity to meet the actual needs of the city, and
he determined to take advantage of this interest to push the project to completion
if possible. He devoted all his spare time to this effort, writing many letters
and taking every other step in his power to secure the money needed for the
purpose. Finally after a year or more of ceaseless effort, he had been able
to secure promises for perhaps half of the minimum amount required, and he
felt that he had just about reached the limit of his resources and that there
existed no alternative to abandoning the entire project. He was sitting at
his desk one morning, turning the matter over in his mind and feeling very
low in spirit, when his phone rang and the caller said, "Doctor, this is
<A NAME="Jim.211" HREF="index.html#Jim">Jim</A> Sparks. I want to talk to you and I want to ask if you will come to my
office for a few minutes. Can you come?"<P ALIGN=LEFT>Jim (I think it was Jim) Sparks
was <A NAME="President.213" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of one of the largest banks in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.213" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> and was probably one
of the wealthiest men in town. He had lost his entire family (except one
son, who was no source of pride to him) some years before, when a ship on
which they were travelling went down off the West coast, with the loss of
all on board. Father knew him personally only in a casual way. When he arrived
Mr. Sparks asked him to sit down and said, "Doctor, I understand that you
are about ready to give up the idea of building a new hospital. Will you
tell me just what the situation is?" Father explained the situation and explained
with much regret that he had just about arrived at that decision. Mr. Sparks
then said, "I have been much interested in the efforts that you have been
making to get that hospital built. I realize fully the difficulties that
you have met with, and I was afraid that you would find them impossible to
overcome. I also feel that if you can't get the hospital built nobody else
in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.226" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> can. I know the urgent need for the hospital and I would hate
to see it given up. Doctor, we have never had occasion to become very well
acquainted with one another, but I don't mind telling you that I have followed
your career with great interest for a good many years and I know more about
you than you probably realize. I have complete confidence in your integrity,
in your ability and in your professional qualifications. I have asked you
to come over and see me because I want to tell you that I have decided that
I will provide whatever funds that are necessary to complete the construction
and equipment of the hospital on two conditions: first, that you will continue
as Chief of Staff of the hospital during its construction and thereafter
as long as you may consider it necessary or advisable that you do so, and,
second, that the hospital be called the Sparks Memorial Hospital, in memory
of my wife."<P ALIGN=LEFT>This generous proposal was carried out in full and enabled
a modern and adequate hospital to be provided for Ft. <A NAME="Smith.239" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Before leaving
this subject I may add that <A NAME="Jim.240" HREF="index.html#Jim">Jim</A> Sparks was one of the principal owners of
the Electric Power and Light Company, and that I have no doubt but that he
had occasion to know about, and bear in mind for many years, the incident
some 15 or 20 years before, of which I told you earlier, when a tired and
struggling young doctor declined to avail himself of what he was quite certain
was the only opportunity he would ever have to take a pleasure trip to far
off places.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I have given you this long, and doubtless dull, account of
the origin of the Sparks Memorial Hospital for this reason: The last time
I was in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.248" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> was in 1937, when I and my brother <A NAME="Drew.248" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A> went back there
to bury our mother beside our father. At that time I was impressed with the
fact that in the generation since my father's death practically all his friends
had died, and there were very few people indeed who remembered him or knew
anything about him.<P ALIGN=LEFT>So far as I know this is the only record that has ever
been made, or that will ever be made, of his contribution to the existence
of this fine hospital.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I recall a little incident that occurred shortly
after the new hospital was built. One morning a prosperous looking farmer,
of about 60, came into Father's office, introduced himself as (say -- I do
not remember the name) <A NAME="Edward.257" HREF="index.html#Edward">Edward</A> <A NAME="Williams.257" HREF="index.html#Williams">Williams</A>, from a small <A NAME="Oklahoma.257" HREF="index.html#Oklahoma">Oklahoma</A> town about
75 miles away and said, "My boy <A NAME="Tom.258" HREF="index.html#Tom">Tom</A>, 20 years old, while unloading hay day
before yesterday, fell and dislocated his hip. Two doctors have been working
on him ever since without being able to help him in any way. They have worked
with his leg so much that he can't stand the pain of having them touch him
now, and they have given him so much anesthetic that they are afraid to give
him any more. They tell me that a large, flat muscle that normally holds
the hip bone in its socket has slipped between the bone and its socket and
that they can't do anything about it. They say that they are afraid he will
never be able to walk again. They have suggested that I bring him to the
hospital in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.267" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> and get the best doctor here to see if there is anything
that can be done for him. <A NAME="Jim.268" HREF="index.html#Jim">Jim</A> <A NAME="Johnson.268" HREF="index.html#Johnson">Johnson</A> (a long time patient and friend of
father's) has advised me to get you to take the case. Will you?" Father told
him that he would provided the boy was brought immediately here by special
train this morning. The father then said, "If you say so, I'll have him brought
here by special train this morning. Before I do, however, I want to say this:
This boy is my only son. He is a fine boy and he will have to take over my
business when I am gone. If he is so crippled that he can't walk, he can't
do that. Now, doctor, I am a businessman, and I like to do things on a business
basis. I am able to pay any amount that is necessary to give the boy the
best medical attention that money can buy if it will enable him to walk again.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars if you will guarantee that he will get well,
but I want a guarantee before I turn him over to you." Father replied, "I
do not practice medicine on that basis; neither does any reputable doctor.
If I take the case I shall give the patient the best treatment I know how
to give him, and I shall charge whatever I think is fair and reasonable.
If you don't consider that this is the only proper way in which I can take
the case, then you will have to get someone else to take it."<P ALIGN=LEFT>After considerable
discussion Mr. <A NAME="Williams.285" HREF="index.html#Williams">Williams</A> reluctantly accepted this, and the boy was brought
to the hospital that afternoon. Father had him put into bed, gave him a mild
sedative and let him sleep until next morning. I heard him talking on the
phone to Dr. <A NAME="Southard.288" HREF="index.html#Southard">Southard</A>, with whom he frequently consulted, telling him, in
effect, "Look on page so and so of ( a recent book) and study carefully the
manipulation there described for reducing a dislocation of this type. You
will note that it requires two operators. I want you to act as No. 2 and
I'll act as No. 1. I'll arrange it so that we both can get our hands in the
proper positions and when I give you the signal you quickly lift the leg
at the knee and turn it and I'll manipulate the thigh." That afternoon Father,
Dr. <A NAME="Southard.295" HREF="index.html#Southard">Southard</A>, and the boy's father (who insisted on being present) came to
the boy's bedside. Father talked to him quietly and assured him that he was
not going to hurt him but meant merely to examine the joint. Gradually he
and Dr. Southard got their hands into the proper positions, and on a signal
they both manipulated the leg. The boy started to cry out in pain, then sat
up and shouted "It's back in. I felt it go back. It's all right." It had
taken perhaps five minutes. In a few days the boy returned home, fully recovered.
Some weeks later Father sent Mr. <A NAME="Williams.302" HREF="index.html#Williams">Williams</A> a bill for $200. In a few days
he received an intemperate letter from Mr. Williams to the effect that it
was utterly unreasonable to expect him to pay $200 for less than five minutes
work, and that if and when he received a reasonable bill he would pay it.
Father replied, reminding him of their previous conversation about the $1000,
stating that while it had taken only five minutes to reduce the dislocation,
it had taken thirty years to learn how to do it, that he considered $200
to be a reasonable charge in this case, that he would not reduce it and that
if Mr. <A NAME="Williams.310" HREF="index.html#Williams">Williams</A> did not feel that it was worth $200 for his son to be able
to walk again he needn't pay anything. A couple of weeks later he received
a letter from Mr. Williams enclosing a check for $200, expressing his gratitude
and apologizing for his previous letter.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Another little incident relating
in a way to the hospital and occurring some time later, may be of interest
to you. In 1900, as I shall explain to you later, Father was realizing a
life long ambition by attending a post graduate course at <A NAME="Johns.316" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.316" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> University
Medical School. While there he became great friends with Dr. <A NAME="Thayer.317" HREF="index.html#Thayer">Thayer</A>, one
of the most famous of the Johns Hopkins professors. It was Dr. Thayer's practice
to take a small group of selected postgraduate students with him occasionally
on his visit through the wards of the famous Johns Hopkins Hospital, to have
them examine the patients in turn and to discuss each case with them. On
one of these occasions he had asked Father if he would like to accompany
him and Father had been delighted to do so. In the course of their round
they came to the bed of an elderly man who was unable to move some of his
joints, which were swollen and painful. <A NAME="Thayer.325" HREF="index.html#Thayer">Thayer</A> had the students examine the
patient and make a diagnosis. After discussing this fully it was agreed that
the patient had what in those days was known as articular rheumatism. Thayer
then had each student state, in turn, what treatment he considered to be
indicated. They advanced various ideas, none of which seemed to satisfy Thayer.
Finally he turned to Father and asked him if he would care to express an
opinion in the matter. Father replied that he would proceed on the basis
that the trouble was attributable to some focus of infection somewhere in
the body, and that he would first endeavor to remove this source of infection.
<A NAME="Thayer.334" HREF="index.html#Thayer">Thayer</A> looked at him with surprise and said: "Doctor, you astonish me. I
have in my desk a paper that is to be published soon in which I advise that
same thing. Until you spoke I believed that I was the first person in the
country to do so. Would you mind telling us how and when you arrived at your
conclusions?" Father replied to this effect: "I am Chief of Staff at the
Hospital in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.339" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>. About a year ago the Head Nurse came to me one morning
and said that she was worried about an old lady in the Charity ward who had
so severe a case of articular rheumatism that she couldn't move in bed, that
she had gradually grown weaker and weaker, was now covered with bed sores,
and was about to die. She asked me if I would please come and look at her.
When I had an opportunity I went, with her, into the ward to examine the
patient. I sat down on the bed and began to examine her. In doing so I leaned
over her face and I was almost nauseated by the odor of decomposition that
came from her mouth. I told her to open her mouth. I could see that she wore
an upper and a lower plate, in filthy condition, and that the mouth was badly
ulcerated. I told the nurse to remove the plates. The old lady shouted that<P ALIGN=LEFT>she
would not allow anyone to remove them, that if she did remove them they wouldn't
fit afterwards, and that she hadn't removed them for ten years. I forcibly
removed them, told the nurse to clean them and the mouth thoroughly, to keep
the plates removed and to treat the mouth until it was thoroughly clean and
healed up and then to report to me. When I examined the patient about ten
days later I found her to be considerably improved. I prescribed a simple
tonic and kept her under observation. She continued to improve rapidly and
in about two weeks she was able to walk out of the hospital.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In endeavoring
to arrive at a conclusion as to the cause of her rapid recovery under practically
no medication, I could not attach special significance to any particular
circumstances except the badly infected mouth. Since the elimination of this
infection had apparently at least contributed to the recovery, I decided
in future similar cases to try and find any possible focus of infection in
the body, such as an infected tooth, tonsil, kidney etc. and to remove or
eliminate it if possible. I found that this generally proved to be effective.
This will explain, I hope, why I made the suggestion I did." <A NAME="Thayer.365" HREF="index.html#Thayer">Thayer</A> turned
to the group of students and said "I hope each of you will remember this
incident as long as you live. I couldn't, in a dozen lectures, have given
you as convincing a demonstration of the importance of a doctor's being able
to observe details, analyze them and make sound conclusions from them. I
know of nothing that is more important to his success." When Father told
me of this incident some years later, it was with what I consider to be a
quite justifiable bit of pride.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Throughout his life he was a great lover
of horses, of which he was an excellent judge, rider, and driver. In my boyhood
there were no automobiles, and for many years he drove a pair of strikingly
handsome bays and it was one of his greatest satisfactions to have people
stop and look at them as he drove by and to be able to pass any other team
on the road. When automobiles had become fairly common he was induced to
buy one. The first time he attempted to back it out of the barn he backed
it through the wall of the barn across the alley. He never got in it again,
but relied upon his horse and buggy as long as he continued in active practice.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Having
been born and raised on a farm, it was quite natural that it should have
been his life long ambition to be able, when the time came, to retire on
a farm, where he could spend his remaining years in raising fine hogs and
stock and crops of potatoes, corn, vegetables and long staple cotton. About
1901 he bought a run down farm of about 200 acres, about six miles from town,
and, for the next ten or more years, he put all his life savings (about $15000)
into fencing his land, building a barn (the largest in the county) and otherwise
developing the farm. At one time he could probably have sold it for $25000,
but he could not convince himself of the wisdom of doing so. In this he was
doubtless influenced by the fact that he had begun to develop a heart condition
that would probably necessitate his retiring from active practice before
long. By about 1920 he and mother moved out to the farm (having sold the
home at 216 N. 7th Street). Fortunately, he was able to spend the remaining
three or four years of his life there, happily surrounded by his chickens,
his horses and his cows, fully occupied with the multitudinous details of
running a farm.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In the summer of 1924 his condition became so serious that
my mother sent for my brother <A NAME="Drew.397" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A> to come home (I was in <A NAME="Panama.397" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A>). Father
had made it a practice not to perform major serious operations, except where
unavoidable in an emergency, but, whenever this was practicable, to build
the patient up to a good physical condition and then take him to either the
<A NAME="Mayo.401" HREF="index.html#Mayo">Mayo</A> Brothers or to <A NAME="Johns.401" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.401" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A> for such an operation, and, realizing his
condition, he agreed to go to the Mayos for treatment. Upon careful examination,
the attending physician advised Drew that the condition of his heart was
such that they could do nothing and they recommended that <A NAME="Drew.404" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A> get him home
as soon as possible.<P ALIGN=LEFT>While on the train, in conversation with Drew, he
suddenly slumped in his seat, unconscious, and died in a few minutes. He
was buried in the Forest Park Cemetery in Fort <A NAME="Smith.407" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>.<P ALIGN=LEFT>He was a man of simple
and straightforward integrity; outspoken in his convictions and intolerant
of cant, hypocrisy or injustice in any form; of many firm and loyal friends;
of simple tastes and habits; a strict but fair disciplinarian; a life long
student; a useful and respected member of his profession and of his community.
His greatest ambition in life was that he might be able to prepare his three
sons for happy, useful and honorable lives. The memory and example of his
character was the most lasting and the most valuable legacy he could have
left them.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I have tried to recall for you a few of the things I remember
about him in the hope that you may feel that you know something about what
kind of man he was.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I was stationed in <A NAME="Panama.417" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> at the time of Father's death.<P>In
view of the isolated location of the farm, to the total lack of modern conveniences
and to the difficulties involved in her attempting to run the farm alone,
my brothers and I decided that mother should not continue to live on the
farm. So everything on the place, except Father's medical library (one of
the best in the state) was sold or given away, and mother went to live with
my brother <A NAME="Dan.423" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A> in St. <A NAME="Helena.423" HREF="index.html#Helena">Helena</A>, <A NAME="California.423" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>. Father's books and papers were
shipped there and stored in a barn on Dan's place. Sometime later the barn
burned down and all the books and papers, including the old family Bible
-- which was the only record we had of our<P ALIGN=LEFT>family history.<P>During the
remainder of her life mother lived with either Dan, <A NAME="Drew.427" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A> or me. She died
October 28, 1936, at <A NAME="Seattle.428" HREF="index.html#Seattle">Seattle</A>, <A NAME="Washington.428" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>, following an operation for gall
stones. Drew and I went back to Ft. <A NAME="Smith.429" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A> to bury her ashes besides father.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Her
entire life was devoted to her husband and her three sons. She had practically
no other interests. She did without things all her life in order that we
might have the things we needed. For her a new dress or a new hat was a rare
occurrence and it was not replaced for years. I do not recall ever hearing
her say an unkind word about any one. I recall but two occasions when she
and father felt they could afford a pleasure trip away from home. One of
these was to attend the <A NAME="Columbian.436" HREF="index.html#Columbian">Columbian</A> Exposition in <A NAME="Chicago.436" HREF="index.html#Chicago">Chicago</A> in 1893, and the
other was when, with a party of friends, they went to <A NAME="Corpus Christi.437" HREF="index.html#Corpus Christi">Corpus Christi</A>, <A NAME="Texas.437" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>
to enjoy a stay of several days on the <A NAME="Gulf.438" HREF="index.html#Gulf">Gulf</A> coast. On this occasion a storm
of such unprecedented severity occurred that they were unable to leave the
<A NAME="Pullman.440" HREF="index.html#Pullman">Pullman</A> car during their stay. She was a life time member of the Baptist
church, and we boys regularly attended Sunday school. Generally we brought
home one of our friends for Sunday dinner, which was quite an occasion as
we boys froze the ice cream to go with the cake that mother had made for
us.<P ALIGN=LEFT>During the years of her life that she spent with one or the other of
us after father's death we tried to make it possible for her to be able to
enjoy a well earned rest. Army life was something entirely new to her and
we were happy that she derived much pleasure from the opportunity that it
afforded her of seeing new places and meeting new people.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Her simple and
unaffected manner, her cheerfulness, her genuine interest in things and in
people, and her thoughtfulness and consideration for others made her many
friends.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Her influence, by precept and example, is one of my most cherished
memories.
