44. Conclusion

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>

December 30, 1959. This is the conclusion (long overdue, I am sure you will
agree) of the recording of some of the random recollections of my life that
I started out to make for you some five years ago, just before my 72nd birthday.
I recently (November 8th) passed my 77th birthday, and I shall conclude this
narrative with a few comments of a retrospective nature.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As I look back over my seventy seven years I realize that I have far more
to be thankful for than most people I know in my parents, my wife, my child
and my grandchildren, of all of whom I am proud and to all of whom I am grateful.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I have had a few close friends, instead of many casual ones, most of whom
are no longer living, but whose friendship I have greatly enjoyed. I have
been most fortunate in my assignments; I have always had good stations and
I have always had a duty assignment that I found most interesting and that,
at the time, I considered more desirable than any other that was available.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I have had a remarkably healthy life, never having been seriously ill and
never having been in a hospital (except for retirement). I have had a busy
life; rarely has there been an evening that I have not been absorbed with
plans for the next day, and the days have never seemed long enough for me
to accomplish all that I desired to do.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
My life has been a quite uneventful one. In nearly 47 years of active service
I have passed through both World Wars without hearing a hostile shot. This
was not of my choosing; I should have preferred duty overseas.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Perhaps some satisfaction may be derived from the fact that the duties to
which I was, in each case, assigned were deemed to be of sufficient importance
to warrant the award of a Distinguished Service Medal in each War.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In a way my service in the Coast Artillery has been contemporaneous with
the life of the Coast Artillery . When I entered it as a junior Lieutenant,
in 1907, it was just emerging from the old smooth bore, muzzle loading, cast
iron guns era. During the nearly forty years that I was associated with it
it was developed to the point that it was undoubtedly the most efficient
seacoast and antiaircraft Artillery in the world. I had witnessed all the
developments made, and it was my good fortune to have had some small share
in some of them.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
When, at the height of its development, it became no longer required, due
to the progress made in aviation, I, at the same time, was retired from further
active service for age.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
It is, to me, a regrettable thing that practically all of the contributions
or accomplishments of my life time, which, at the time seemed important to
me, should suddenly have become of no importance or permanent value, and
that they shall soon be forgotten entirely. Such, however, I suppose, is
life.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I do not anticipate that there will be many events in my future life in regard
to which my recollections will be any more interesting to you than your own.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
So I plan, during such time as remains to me, to devote my time chiefly to
the upkeep of the place, to reading (mostly who-done-its, I fear), to enjoying
the companionship of my family and of my few remaining old friends, to occasionally
working in my shop, and to watching, with ever increasing pride and satisfaction,
the progress and accomplishments of you, my children (in which I include
<A NAME="Perry.87" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A>) and my grandchildren. I am sure that, in time, they will afford you
all many satisfactory and pleasant reminiscences of your own.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I hope that I may have the good fortune to have you all here with us many
times in the future. Perhaps I may then be able to subject you to further
random recollections.
