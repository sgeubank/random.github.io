19. Our Wedding

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>

We were married at St, <A NAME="Michael.20" HREF="index.html#Michael">Michael</A>'s Church, in <A NAME="Charleston.20" HREF="index.html#Charleston">Charleston</A>, on April 14, 1917.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
<A NAME="Winthrop.23" HREF="index.html#Winthrop">Winthrop</A> <A NAME="Cowdin.23" HREF="index.html#Cowdin">Cowdin</A> gave the bride away; my parents came from <A NAME="Arkansas.23" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> for the
wedding; the ushers were my brothers <A NAME="Dan.24" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A> and <A NAME="Drew.24" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A>, Captain <A NAME="Alfred.24" HREF="index.html#Alfred">Alfred</A> <A NAME="Hasbrouck.24" HREF="index.html#Hasbrouck">Hasbrouck</A>
and Captain <A NAME="Marion.25" HREF="index.html#Marion">Marion</A> Battle; the best man was Captain <A NAME="Percy.25" HREF="index.html#Percy">Percy</A> <A NAME="Bishop.25" HREF="index.html#Bishop">Bishop</A>; the bridesmaids
were <A NAME="Louise.26" HREF="index.html#Louise">Louise</A> <A NAME="Buffington.26" HREF="index.html#Buffington">Buffington</A> and <A NAME="Margaret.26" HREF="index.html#Margaret">Margaret</A> <A NAME="Barker.26" HREF="index.html#Barker">Barker</A>, of <A NAME="Fall River.26" HREF="index.html#Fall River">Fall River</A> and the maid of
honor was <A NAME="Helen.27" HREF="index.html#Helen">Helen</A> <A NAME="Pond.27" HREF="index.html#Pond">Pond</A> of <A NAME="Brookline.27" HREF="index.html#Brookline">Brookline</A>, <A NAME="Mass.27" HREF="index.html#Mass">Mass</A>. General <A NAME="Townsley.27" HREF="index.html#Townsley">Townsley</A>, his staff and
a number of officers from Ft. <A NAME="Moultrie.28" HREF="index.html#Moultrie">Moultrie</A> were present. The War had begun on
April 6th, and the only reason I was able to get a 10 day leave of absence
was that my best man happened to be the Personnel Officer in the office of
the Chief of Coast Artillery.

The officers all wore full dress uniforms, and the guests at the reception
(at 2 1/2 <A NAME="Lamboll.35" HREF="index.html#Lamboll">Lamboll</A> Street) following the ceremony all said that the wedding
had been a beautiful one. I had a very distinct recollection that the bride
had been a very beautiful one, but I was rather hazy about the rest of it.

After the reception we came to <A NAME="Summerville.40" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A> and spent several days at the
Pine Forest Inn, which, in those days, was a famous resort. The we went to
the <A NAME="Grove.42" HREF="index.html#Grove">Grove</A> Park Inn, at <A NAME="Ashville.42" HREF="index.html#Ashville">Ashville</A>, for several days, then to the <A NAME="Chamberlain.42" HREF="index.html#Chamberlain">Chamberlain</A>
Hotel, at Fort <A NAME="Monroe.43" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>, for a day or two, and then to the <A NAME="Belmont.43" HREF="index.html#Belmont">Belmont</A> Hotel (then
quite new, but now long since torn down) in <A NAME="New York.44" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> for a day or two before
going to Fort <A NAME="Totten.45" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A>. Our stay at the Belmont was extended several days on
account of a delay in the Railway Express. Your grandmother was the fifth
generation of an only daughter. The original maternal grandmother had willed
to her daughter an old mahogany gate leg table, upon which the new bride
had had her first meal in her new home, and the custom had been continued
in each succeeding generation. This table had been shipped by express from
<A NAME="Charleston.51" HREF="index.html#Charleston">Charleston</A>, but was delayed somewhere in route. We couldn't possibly go out
to Fort <A NAME="Totten.52" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A> until the table arrived, so we decided to stay on at the <A NAME="Belmont.52" HREF="index.html#Belmont">Belmont</A>
(at some $25 a day) until it did arrive.

One evening, as we sat down to dinner in the hotel, preparatory to going
to the theater, the Head waiter brought me a telegram. It was from the Chief
of Coast Artillery, and it directed me to report to him in <A NAME="Washington.58" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> next
morning -- I had no idea for what. I turned in the theater tickets, hastily
packed my bag and caught the next train for Washington.
