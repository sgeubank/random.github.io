24. AT THE ARMY WAR COLLEGE.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The War College was reopened, and the first class was to report, in September,
1921.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Since my detail on the General Staff would be terminated in October, and
since General <A NAME="March.27" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was to be relieved by General <A NAME="Pershing.27" HREF="index.html#Pershing">Pershing</A> at an early date,
I decided to ask to be relieved from my detail with the General Staff on
August 24th and, after a short leave, to be detailed to take the War College
course. Although I had been included in the Initial General Staff Eligible
List, there were several reasons why I desired to take the War College course
at this time. The faculty and the students were carefully selected, and most
of them had held high commands in the AEF; I hoped to learn much from their
experience. Furthermore there was to be considered the fact that we were
comfortably settled at the <A NAME="Farnsboro.35" HREF="index.html#Farnsboro">Farnsboro</A>, in <A NAME="Washington.35" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>, and that this was the
most favorable time for me to go to the War College if I was ever to go.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
There was still another consideration, not without significance to you, that
had to be borne in mind. We were expecting that, within a few months, there
would be an increase of one in our family. I am sure that you will be glad
to learn that this expectation was realized on December 31, 1921, when, at
11:30 p.m. (just in time to reduce somewhat my Income Tax) a five pound daughter,
whom we named <A NAME="Shirley.44" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> (simply because we liked the name) was born at <A NAME="Columbia.44" HREF="index.html#Columbia">Columbia</A>
Hospital, Dr. <A NAME="Staveley.45" HREF="index.html#Staveley">Staveley</A> being the Master of Ceremonies.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I enjoyed the War College Course, particularly the G-2 Course, which was
conducted by Colonel <A NAME="Embick.49" HREF="index.html#Embick">Embick</A>, one of my oldest friends, and, as I have stated,
in my opinion one of the ablest, most influential and most modest officers
of my time. He had been Chief of Staff for General <A NAME="Bliss.51" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> (our representative
on the Supreme War Council) (General <A NAME="Foch.52" HREF="index.html#Foch">Foch</A> had written him a letter stating
that no officer in the Allied Armies had exerted a greater influence on the
strategy of the War than he had), and he had been on one of the committees
that had drafted the Peace Treaty. He had, I believe, a more profound knowledge
of international affairs than any officer in the Army, and his Course was
designed to give his students an insight into the political, economic, ethnic
and other considerations affecting the war potential and the possible causes
of war of each of the nations that had been engaged in World War I.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Colonel <A NAME="Charles.62" HREF="index.html#Charles">Charles</A> E. <A NAME="Kilbourne.62" HREF="index.html#Kilbourne">Kilbourne</A>, another good friend of mine, was head of the
G-1 Course. He told me afterwards of an incident that amused me. General
<A NAME="McLaughlin.64" HREF="index.html#McLaughlin">McLaughlin</A>, the Commandant of the War College, gave a great deal of his time
and personal attention to the preparation of the Efficiency Reports of both
the faculty and the student officers. He called upon the Head of each Course
to submit a complete report (on the regular Form) on each student officer.
After these reports had been received and studied by General McLaughlin,
he sent for Colonel <A NAME="Kilbourne.69" HREF="index.html#Kilbourne">Kilbourne</A> and said, in substance: "I have noted a rather
unusual thing in the reports on Major <A NAME="Gardner.70" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>. Colonel <A NAME="King.70" HREF="index.html#King">King</A> (head of the
Command Course, and a former All American football player at <A NAME="West Point.71" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>)
rates him as average in Physical Endurance, while you rate him as Superior.
Can you explain why this marked difference should exist?" Colonel Kilbourne
replied, "I think that perhaps it is due to the fact that Colonel King does
not know him as well as I do. I have known him for a good many years. I happen
to know that he and General <A NAME="Bishop.76" HREF="index.html#Bishop">Bishop</A> walked forty miles, to <A NAME="Baltimore.76" HREF="index.html#Baltimore">Baltimore</A>, on the
last Fourth of July just for recreation, and I know that he worked, without
regard to hours, as Secretary of the General Staff, throughout the War, as
right hand man to General <A NAME="March.79" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, without any ill effects upon his physical
or mental endurance. I consider that such a four year test justifies for
him a rating of Superior in Physical Endurance." Of course, to make the story
complete (or else it would doubtless never have been told to me) General
<A NAME="McLaughlin.83" HREF="index.html#McLaughlin">McLaughlin</A> rated me Superior.

At the completion of the Course, just before graduation, General McLaughlin
had about a dozen of the graduating students assembled in his office. He
said to them, in substance: "I think it is only fair to you young gentlemen
to tell you that I have watched your work during the past year with close
attention, and that you have been outstanding among the class. I shall so
state on your Efficiency Reports." I am glad to say that I happened to be
among those present.

Upon my graduation, in June, 1922, from the War College, I was informed by
the Personnel Officer in the Office of the Chief of Coast Artillery, Major
<A NAME="Clifford.97" HREF="index.html#Clifford">Clifford</A> <A NAME="Jones.97" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A> (an old friend -- we had both lived in the <A NAME="Farnsboro.97" HREF="index.html#Farnsboro">Farnsboro</A> during
most of the War) that I was at the very top of the list of the Majors due
for foreign service, but that, as no vacancy then existed, I would be sent
to Camp <A NAME="Eustis.100" HREF="index.html#Eustis">Eustis</A>, <A NAME="Virginia.100" HREF="index.html#Virginia">Virginia</A>, where, under the approved policy, I could expect
to stay for not less than one year.
