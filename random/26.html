26. SERVICE IN PANAMA

</H3>
<HR>


<P>
We arrived in <A NAME="Panama.22" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> November 30, 1922, with one 11 months old baby and about
four suitcases at least 11 years old.

<P>
We were met at <A NAME="Balboa.26" HREF="index.html#Balboa">Balboa</A> by General R. E. <A NAME="Callan.26" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A> (he had been my instructor
in Math at <A NAME="West Point.27" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, and was the best one I had ever had), who was in command
of the Panama <A NAME="Canal.28" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A> Coast Artillery District, with Headquarters at Fort <A NAME="Amador.28" HREF="index.html#Amador">Amador</A>,
and who insisted that we come and stay with them until we could move into
our quarters there. We discovered some months later that Mrs. Callan (they
had no children) was more than surprised when we arrived with a baby -- a
circumstance which she apparently had had no reason to foresee. However she
was a good sport and was most hospitable to us all during our stay of perhaps
a week with them.

<P>
We finally moved into a very nice set of quarters, which had been equipped
with the very limited amount of QM furniture then allowed. However, we had
no great worry as we expected our own furniture to arrive within a few weeks.
As a matter of fact no transport arrived for over four months -- for what
I suppose was a very good reason, although even at the time it was not entirely
clear to me just what it was.

<P>
General <A NAME="Callan.45" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A> had graduated 4 in his class (1896) at <A NAME="West Point.45" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. He had
a remarkably analytical mind and the ability to express himself clearly and
lucidly. He was the outstanding Gunnery expert in the Army. The period of
nearly three years that I spent under his command was one of the most interesting
and instructive of my service.

<P>
He told me that he had assigned me to the Harbor Defenses of <A NAME="Balboa.52" HREF="index.html#Balboa">Balboa</A>,with
station at Fort <A NAME="Amador.53" HREF="index.html#Amador">Amador</A>, with the idea in mind that I should become Executive
Officer and should take charge of the schools for the young officers for
the particular purpose of giving them a thorough grounding in Gunnery for
Coast Artillery. He personally conducted a critique after each target practice
and his comments on the Gunnery technique employed in the practice were an
education in themselves. I prepared a booklet on Gunnery (which was later
used as the basis of a similar one at the Coast Artillery School) and broadened
the scope of their instruction as much as possible.

<P>
The Commanding Officer of the Harbor Defenses was Colonel <A NAME="John.63" HREF="index.html#John">John</A> T. <A NAME="Geary.63" HREF="index.html#Geary">Geary</A>.
When I reported to him he said: " There are four or five islands, all fortified,
in the Harbor Defense. I have been here only about two months and I haven't
yet had time to learn what their names are. You have arrived at a very opportune
time. We are to have a Tactical Inspection by the Department and District
Commanders in about two weeks, and I want you to take complete charge of
the preparations for this inspection."

<P>
I went out to <A NAME="Naos.72" HREF="index.html#Naos">Naos</A> Island to inspect the Battle Command Station, which was
located there. This was probably the finest fortification in the world. The
island consisted of a solid rock and was about 200 feet high. A tunnel, in
which was located the switchboard room and all the power plants, several
hundred feet long led to an elevator which went up to the top of the island,
passing the magazines which were carved out of the rock under the batteries
(a 12" Gun Battery and a 12" Mortar Battery). The Battle Commander's Station
was located on the flank and rear of the Gun Battery. It was a single room
about ten feet square, and on the walls there were some 13 telephones, with
direct lines to each searchlight, Group Commander, etc. The enlisted man
in charge told me there had been no drill for several months.

<P>
When I returned to Headquarters I asked the Adjutant if there existed any
Battle Orders for the Harbor Defense. He stated that he was quite sure there
were some such orders, and after a long search he finally found a copy, covering
about half a sheet of letter size paper, which he gave to me. There were,
as I recall it, five sectors in the field of fire (<A NAME="Taboga.89" HREF="index.html#Taboga">Taboga</A>, Taboga Left, etc.).
There were five Battle Orders. The first one read "Battle Order No. 1. The
enemy has been located in Taboga Sector. Battery Commander's Action." Battle
Order No. 2 read "The enemy has been located in <A NAME="Taboguilla.92" HREF="index.html#Taboguilla">Taboguilla</A> Sector. Battery
Commander's Action," and so on for the remaining three sectors. This was
all, in the nature of Plans, orders or doctrines for Battle Action that existed
for my guidance at the tactical inspection in two weeks. I began daily communication
drills to train all personnel at least in the use of the telephone; there
was but little time for anything else.

<P>
I shall never forget that first Tactical Inspection. At the appointed hour
the Department Commander and the Coast Artillery District Commander, each
with about half a dozen staff officers, entered the station (there was Standing
Room only). General <A NAME="Callan.103" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A> then handed me a sheet of legal size paper, filled
with single space typing and headed "Special Situation." Since it set forth
just what enemy ships were supposed to be visible from the stations, I decided
that all the various commanders should be advised as to its contents, in
order that if, as I expected, certain telephone lines were ruled out of action
during the action, the commanders concerned could still conduct independent
action. So I announced to the 13 telephone operators: "All stations prepare
to copy Special Situation". Then I began reading it, a sentence or less at
a time, while the 13 telephone operators repeated it. The noise and confusion
during each transmission enabled me to visualize much more realistically
than I had ever been able to do so before just what the Tower of <A NAME="Babel.113" HREF="index.html#Babel">Babel</A> must
have been like.

<P>
As time passed, with very lagging feet, (it must have taken ten minutes to
complete the message), the perspiration began to run down my back and I heaved
(mentally) a sigh of relief when quietness finally reigned in the station.
While I was valiantly struggling to get a second wind I heard one of the
telephone operators say, "What did you say? I can't understand you. Talk
a little bit slower, etc., etc." The two Generals and their staffs were listening
attentively when the telephone operator, with a look betokening great pride
in his success in finally being able to understand the man at the other end
of his telephone line, broke the silence that enwrapped the station, and,
while everyone was listening with rapt attention, said "This here guy says
to repeat that last message." I decided that the best thing I could do, under
the circumstances, was not to hear the man, and fortunately, while I was
doing my best not to hear him, General <A NAME="Callan.129" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A>, who entirely understood the
situation, came to my rescue by giving me some further directions. I never
was more embarrassed than at this Inspection. The Department Commander and
his staff, however, apparently thought all the noise and confusion was normal
Coast Artillery procedure and seemed to be very favorably impressed.

<P>
I made up my mind that the next Tactical Inspection would be different. The
fortifications of the <A NAME="Panama.137" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> <A NAME="Canal.137" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A> were the most modern and the most elaborate
in our service. The Fire Control system, however, was basically the same
as that used in the earliest days of the Coast Artillery. Thus separate and
independent telephone lines ran from each command echelon to each of its
lower echelons, from each station to its plotting room, and from each searchlight
to its individual observation station, which controlled it. The system was
entirely without flexibility. In an emergency it would be impracticable to
utilize any observation station to serve the plotting room of any other battery,
no searchlight could be controlled or directed by any station except the
one to which it was connected by telephone, if the command post of any echelon
were put out of action tactical control of the units of that echelon was
entirely disrupted, and, in general, no element of the command knew what
orders were being issued to any other unit. The Battle Command station was
located on the rear edge of a concrete apron about 50 feet wide and one projectile
ricocheting from this apron or making a direct hit on the station would have
disrupted the entire tactical chain of command.

<P>
As the result of a careful study of the situation I decided that it was essential
that the communications system be as flexible as possible, in order that
any enemy fire might result in the minimum disruption of the tactical chain
of command or in other essential communication lines. This involved practically
a rebuilding of the entire communication system and the building of entirely
new switchboards. The War Department Regulations provided that no change
in the Fire Control installation as approved and installed could be made
without specific approval of the War Department. I felt quite sure that any
such radical changes as were proposed, in the latest fortification built,
would not be approved, and that the funds required for the new switchboards
could not be secured in the absence of such War Department approval. The
Department Signal Officer, after being thoroughly briefed on the entire situation,
agreed to utilize the Fire Control maintenance funds normally available to
procure the slate panels, jacks, plugs, and other new parts required, and
the new switchboards were constructed and installed by post labor, and the
necessary changes were made in the communications themselves.

<P>
The new system allowed any line on the switchboard to be plugged in readily
to any one or more lines desired. It also provided, at each echelon, a command
or order net in which all commanders of subordinate units of the echelon
would be, and were, connected. Thus the Battle Commander could, if he so
desired, talk directly to all Group Commanders in a net, and any Action Orders
to any one or more Groups would be understood by all the other Group Commanders,
and in case the line from the Battle Commander's station to the switchboard
were put out of service, the net of Group Commanders remained intact and
the senior Group Commander could continue the action, without interruption.

<P>
Similar arrangements were made in each Group.

<P>
Concurrently with this work we were working on a simple system of four or
five Action Orders which would enable the Battle or Group Commander to issue,
in very few words, an order that would prescribe any kind fo fire distribution
or concentration, on any number of targets, that he might desire, very much
like the procedure employed for that purpose by the Navy.

<P>
All this work was completed before the time of the next Tactical Inspection,
and the command was thoroughly drilled in the use of the new system.

<P>
In the meanwhile General <A NAME="Lassiter.198" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>, one of the ablest Field Artillerymen in
the Army, had become Department Commander. One night, about a month before
the Tactical Inspection, we were guests of General Lassiter at dinner at
his quarters at Quarry Heights, together with about half a dozen other people.

<P>
After dinner, while the men were having their coffee on the lanai, General
<A NAME="Lassiter.205" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A> turned to me and asked how we were getting along in preparing for
the Tactical Inspection. I told him that we had been working hard to get
everything in shape. He then said, "I have witnessed a great many Coast Artillery
target practices. In practically every case it has involved the fire of one
battery on one target. They have done very well under these conditions. But
these conditions are, in no way, similar to those that you would be confronted
with in the case of action by an enemy fleet, where it would be necessary
for the fire of all batteries to be distributed among the various ships of
the enemy formation. I have never seen a practice where this was done, and,
frankly, I don't believe it is possible for accurate fire to be delivered
under such conditions." This put me on the spot before the other officers
present, none of whom were Coast Artillerymen, and I felt that it was up
to me to speak up for the Coast Artillery. So I brashly replied, "Well, General,
I believe it can be done, and I will be personally responsible that it will
be done at your Tactical Inspection if you will have the targets located
within the field of fire so that simultaneous fire may be delivered by all
the Groups of the command."

<P>
We then began frantically to develop an elaborate Spotting Service. Each
Battery set up a terrestrial horizontal baseline, equipped for bilateral
spotting direct to the Battery Plotting Room. We also got in touch with the
Air Corps and got them to agree to furnish us one plane for spotting. At
that time no radio had been installed in any of our planes, but there was
one plane, at <A NAME="Panama.229" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A>, the pilot of which had installed some of his own equipment
which, if everything went just right, would permit him to send and receive
telegraph signals to and from the ground. The system that we used was that
he reported, by using single letters, the distance each shot observed in
sequence was over or short of the target. He made no attempt to identify
the firing Battery or the caliber of the shot. His reports were received
in a room where there was a man from each Battery. This man was notified
by his plotting room when each shot was fired by that Battery and at the
end of the time of flight he was told "Spot", at which word he reported the
next spot received. At each Battery there was a Board upon which was recorded
the land spot and the airplane spot for each spot, together with the correction,
if any, applied as the result of the spotting. We had frequent drills with
all personnel involved.

<P>
On the morning of the Inspection, at daylight our observers reported four
pyramidal targets in the field of fire. The umpire advised us that these
targets (which had been located, by General <A NAME="Lassiter.246" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>'s orders, so that the
four groups of major caliber armament could fire at them) represented a battleship
division approaching in line.

<P>
For the Inspection no one was allowed in the Battle Commander's station except
me and the two telephone operators, one of whom was connected on the Group
Commanders net.

<P>
Immediately upon being advised by General <A NAME="Lassiter.256" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A> as to the nature of the
targets, I said, in an ordinary tone of voice, to the Order Net operator,
"Action Order for Groups one, two, three and four -- Action four -- Commence
Firing." In about a minute all Batteries began firing, and it was apparent
to all observers that each target was under fire. At the end of about ten
minutes all the firing was finished. The finish was quite spectacular as
the last shot fired was a direct hit on one of the targets, which was destroyed.

<P>
This Inspection had been quite different from the preceding one, and General
<A NAME="Callan.266" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A> had observed it with much satisfaction.

<P>
Immediately after the conclusion of the practice I reported to General <A NAME="Lassiter.269" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>
that the firing was completed. He replied, "I should like to inspect each
Battery Commander's station to observe the records kept during the practice."
In every case the Blackboard showed that every shot fired had been spotted
by both the terrestrial and the aerial spotters, and that the corrections
that had been applied as the result of the spotting had resulted in an excellent
adjustment of fire. The odds against every shot being spotted successfully
by both methods used were astronomically great, and no one was more surprised
-- or pleased -- than I was, although I made no comment to General <A NAME="Lassiter.277" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>.

<P>
He then directed that all the officers be assembled. When this was done he
said, "I have stated that I did not believe it possible for the fire of all
Batteries to be delivered simultaneously and to be observed and corrected
effectively. I wish to say that no one could have observed this practice
without being compelled to admit that it can, and has been, done today."

<P>
I have probably bored you beyond words by this long dissertation. My only
excuse is that, as I look back, this was perhaps the outstanding day of my
career as a Coast Artillery officer.

<P>
About this time the construction of a new 16" battery at <A NAME="Bruja Point.292" HREF="index.html#Bruja Point">Bruja Point</A> was
authorized, and I was <A NAME="President.293" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Board to recommend the types and locations
of the Fire Control stations and searchlights (mostly on <A NAME="Taboga.294" HREF="index.html#Taboga">Taboga</A> and <A NAME="Taboguilla.294" HREF="index.html#Taboguilla">Taboguilla</A>
Islands) and the details of the Fire Control installation. The system recommended
by the Board conformed closely to that which we had recently installed throughout
the Harbor Defense, and after careful consideration by the War Department
it was adopted, with some minor changes, as the standard Fire Control system
for future installations.

<P>
About this time also there was another interesting development. One of the
General Staff officers at Department Headquarters (Colonel Mm. (sic) <A NAME="Ennis.303" HREF="index.html#Ennis">Ennis</A>,
a rabid Field Artilleryman, realizing that Fort <A NAME="Amador.304" HREF="index.html#Amador">Amador</A>, one of the most desirable
posts in the Army, was occupied by the Coast Artillery, while the Field Artillery
was stationed at a much less desirable post in the interior of the <A NAME="Canal.306" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A>
Zone, and having in mind the fact that General <A NAME="Lassiter.307" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A> had stated that he
considered that any probable enemy attack on the Canal would probably be
in the nature of a landing party with the mission of blowing up the locks,
he recommended to General Lassiter that the Coast Artillery be replaced by
Field Artillery, whose guns were more suitable for repelling a landing attack
than the major caliber armament manned by the Coast Artillery. This recommendation
was given serious consideration by General Lassiter, and he said something
to me about it. I had previously heard of the recommendation and had been
giving the matter much thought. I told General <A NAME="Lassiter.315" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A> that there existed
no reason why the Coast Artillery personnel at any fixed battery should not
install a battery of 155 millimeter GPF guns, or one of 75 mm. guns in the
immediate vicinity of the fixed guns or the Field guns, depending on the
nature of the attack, employing the same Plotting Room for both, and that
we had, in reserve storage, 24 155 mm. guns and a number of 75 mm. guns which
could be used for this purpose. This plan of "Dual Assignments" was adopted
and I had charge of the emplacing of these guns. (On <A NAME="Naos.322" HREF="index.html#Naos">Naos</A> Island this involved
lifting the 155 mm. guns about 200 feet vertically, an operation that, with
the equipment available involved some danger to the personnel involved.)
In order to afford the 155 mm. guns a wide field of fire, I had constructed
a concrete base which would permit a 155 mm. gun to fire readily in any desired
direction. This mount, known as a "<A NAME="Panama.327" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> mount", became standard for all
155 mm. guns in the Harbor Defenses. In might perhaps be said that in this
case "necessity was the daughter of intentions" -- that is of Colonel <A NAME="Ennis.329" HREF="index.html#Ennis">Ennis</A>'s
intentions.

<P>
In addition to my other duties I was Mine Commander throughout my stay at
Fort <A NAME="Amador.334" HREF="index.html#Amador">Amador</A>. While I was at the Torpedo Depot I had, with the approval of
the Chief of Coast Artillery, had built, by the E. W. <A NAME="Bliss.335" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> Company, twenty
submarine mines of a submergence controllable type, under the patent of Captain
<A NAME="Leon.337" HREF="index.html#Leon">Leon</A>, of the <A NAME="Swedish.337" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> Navy, to be tested for possible use at the <A NAME="Pacific.337" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> entrance
to the <A NAME="Panama.338" HREF="index.html#Panama">Panama</A> <A NAME="Canal.338" HREF="index.html#Canal">Canal</A>, where the daily tidal range is about eighteen feet (as
compared with eighteen inches on the <A NAME="Atlantic.339" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A> side.) It was somewhat of a
coincidence that it fell to my lot to be the one to make the final test on
those mines. As the result of an extended test, I reported that they could
not be used satisfactorily at Panama on account of the fact that in that
tropical climate, in a short time marine growths attached themselves on the
exposed drum on which the mooring rope was wound to such an extent as to
prevent its proper functioning.

<P>
Our three years tour of duty at Fort <A NAME="Amador.348" HREF="index.html#Amador">Amador</A> has always been remembered as
about the most enjoyable of our entire service.

<P>
It was, however, saddened for me by the fact that my father, on August 16th,
1924, died, from a heart attack, while in route home, with my brother <A NAME="Drew.353" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A>,
from the <A NAME="Mayo.354" HREF="index.html#Mayo">Mayo</A>. Clinic, where he had gone for consultation.

<P>
Shortly afterwards (Father was buried in the Forest Park Cemetery, in Fort
<A NAME="Smith.358" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>) my brother <A NAME="Dan.358" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A> went to Fort Smith and moved my mother, with Father's
books and papers, to his home in St. <A NAME="Helena.359" HREF="index.html#Helena">Helena</A>, <A NAME="California.359" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>. These books and
papers he stored in his barn, and, some time later, the barn was burned to
the ground. The books included the old Family Bible, which contained the
only existing Register of Marriages, Births and Deaths pertaining to my family
-- a loss that I have deeply regretted since reaching an age when such data
would have been most interesting.
