28. ADVANCED COURSE, C.A.S.

</H3>
<HR>


<P>
At that time the Advanced Course at the Coast Artillery School was simply
a Preparatory School for the C&GS School at Ft. <A NAME="Leavenworth.23" HREF="index.html#Leavenworth">Leavenworth</A>. I was on the
Initial General Staff Eligible List, and was a graduate of the War College,
and I had felt that no material advantage would accrue to me from my going
to Leavenworth. However, on the advice of General <A NAME="Callan.26" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A>, I decided that
it would be a good thing for me to have it on my record that I had taken
the Course at Leavenworth, since apparently most graduates of that Course
seemed to think that no officer who had not taken that Course was qualified
to be a general officer. So I applied for the Advanced Course and was graduated
from it July 15th, 1927.

<P>
I recall with some amusement one incident which occurred during my stay at
Fort <A NAME="Monroe.35" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>. A Colonel <A NAME="Brady.35" HREF="index.html#Brady">Brady</A> <A NAME="Mitchell.35" HREF="index.html#Mitchell">Mitchell</A> was in charge of training in the office
of Chief of Coast Artillery. His duties included the supervision of the preparation
of manuals, texts, correspondence courses, etc. by the Department of Extension
Courses at the Coast Artillery School. He was not a very brilliant officer,
and was liable, once having gotten an idea, to carry it to extremes.

<P>
The School at <A NAME="Leavenworth.42" HREF="index.html#Leavenworth">Leavenworth</A> had been emphasizing for some time the importance
of a message center as part of the G-2 set up of larger units in the field,
and Colonel <A NAME="Mitchell.44" HREF="index.html#Mitchell">Mitchell</A> had apparently decided that the Coast Artillery should
not be outdone by any body and that it should have message centers too. Personally
I felt that there was no possible use for a Message Center of the type used
in a Division in a Coast Artillery Fire Control station.

<P>
Colonel Mitchell was scheduled to make an inspection of the Post of Fort
<A NAME="Monroe.51" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A> on a certain date, and some of the Post officers, knowing of his obsession
about Message Centers, came to me for advice as there was no Message Center
in their setup. As the result of our conference we had a large sign painted
"TO MESSAGE CENTER", in red letters, with a large arrow pointing in that
direction. At every turn along the path to one of the old casemates in the
old fort similar signs were posted and in the casemate an experienced Sergeant,
in full uniform, was seated behind a table on which there was a telephone.
Colonel <A NAME="Mitchell.58" HREF="index.html#Mitchell">Mitchell</A> duly followed the signs to the "Message Center", looked
at it and complimented the Sergeant in charge. Perhaps it was just as well
that he did not observe that the telephone was not connected to any one.
