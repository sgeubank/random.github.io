6. Move to <A NAME="Oxford.15" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>

After about three years' practice
at <A NAME="LaFayette.19" HREF="index.html#LaFayette">LaFayette</A> Springs, father was invited by Dr. <A NAME="Isom.19" HREF="index.html#Isom">Isom</A> to become his partner,
and we moved to Oxford.<P ALIGN=LEFT>There is an incident that occurred during the period
of four or five years that we lived in Oxford that I recall my father's telling
me about. He had been made <A NAME="President.22" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Board of Health. A very severe
epidemic of Yellow Fever had broken out in New <A NAME="Orleans.23" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A> and hundreds of people
had died. In desperation, thousands of people who had the means were getting
out of New Orleans, and trainloads of them were coming into <A NAME="Mississippi.25" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> seeking
refuge. At that time it was not known how Yellow Fever was transmitted. Father
felt that, irrespective of how the fever was transmitted, it was reasonable
to assume that persons who had been exposed to it in New Orleans would probably
constitute a source of danger to others who had not been so exposed. So he
recommended to the city authorities that no one from New <A NAME="Orleans.30" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A> be allowed
to come to <A NAME="Oxford.31" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A> while the epidemic was under way. This was strenuously
opposed by many of the people of Oxford. The newspapers in the neighboring
city of Water Valley bitterly attacked the people of Oxford for considering
such a heartless plan, and large notices were prominently displayed in the
papers inviting refugees from New Orleans to avail themselves of the hospitality
of Water Valley, and several trainloads of people came to that city. In spite
of the mounting criticism of many of the people of Oxford, father stuck to
his guns, and finally placed armed guards at every entrance to the city to
enforce the quarantine. Within a few days the worst Yellow Fever epidemic
in the history of Water Valley broke out and hundreds died. There was no
case of Yellow Fever in <A NAME="Oxford.41" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>. I have no doubt but that this was a great
relief to the <A NAME="President.42" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Board.
