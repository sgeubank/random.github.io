35. IN COMMAND OF THE H.S.C.A. BRIGADE

</H3>
<HR align=left>


<P>
Early in December I took a Transport from <A NAME="New York.22" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, leaving <A NAME="Eleanor.22" HREF="index.html#Eleanor">Eleanor</A> and <A NAME="Shirley.22" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A>
behind, Shirley to continue at <A NAME="Ashley.23" HREF="index.html#Ashley">Ashley</A> Hall until her graduation in June,
when they would both join me in <A NAME="Honolulu.24" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A>.

<P>
I recall an incident that occurred during the trip on the Transport. Among
the passengers were Brig. Gen. <A NAME="George.28" HREF="index.html#George">George</A> <A NAME="Pillsbury.28" HREF="index.html#Pillsbury">Pillsbury</A> and his wife. General Pillsbury,
a distinguished Engineer officer (he had made the highest grades ever made
by a cadet at <A NAME="West Point.30" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>) had recently retired and was in route to <A NAME="San Francisco.30" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A>,
where he was to make his home. His family and I had a small table in the
Dining Room, and in the course of the conversation one day the subject of
Midway Island came up. I told them about the trip I had taken to Midway on
the <A NAME="Itaska.34" HREF="index.html#Itaska">Itaska</A> and I told them about a large silver loving cup that had been
given to the cable station by the passengers of the <A NAME="Mongolia.35" HREF="index.html#Mongolia">Mongolia</A>. In 1906, I
told them, the <A NAME="Pacific.36" HREF="index.html#Pacific">Pacific</A> Mail Steamer Mongolia was on her way to San Francisco
from <A NAME="Yokohama.37" HREF="index.html#Yokohama">Yokohama</A>. On board was the then General Manager of the Cable Company
and his daughter, a very beautiful and attractive girl. She had heard many
tales about the Midway cable station, and before embarking she had begged
her father to get the Mongolia to go enough out of its way enough to stop
at Midway for a short stay. Her father finally agreed to ask the <A NAME="President.41" HREF="index.html#President">President</A>
of the steamship company, who was a friend of his, to instruct the Captain
of the <A NAME="Mongolia.43" HREF="index.html#Mongolia">Mongolia</A> to do so. The instructions received by the Captain specified
that the ship was not to be taken within three miles of the shore on account
of the coral reefs that were known to exist.

<P>
When the Mongolia arrived, however, the Captain, noting how clear and blue
the water was, decided it would be safe and save time to come in nearer the
shore. He ran aground on a reef, and after trying in vain for some days to
get off the reef, he transferred some 600 passengers and crew together with
all the provisions, liquors, stores and chefs ashore, when the cable operators
vacated their barracks and installed the passengers in them. This holiday,
certainly under very unusual conditions, lasted for several weeks and the
passengers were so delighted with it that they gave the cable station the
beautiful loving cup of which I had spoken.

<P>
Upon the completion of my story Mrs. <A NAME="Pillsbury.59" HREF="index.html#Pillsbury">Pillsbury</A> said: "Your story is substantially
correct in the details. I was the young girl who was the innocent cause of
the <A NAME="Mongolia.61" HREF="index.html#Mongolia">Mongolia</A>'s going aground." I was very glad that I had emphasized the
fact that the young girl was beautiful and attractive, although I had no
information to that effect.

<P>
I arrived at <A NAME="Honolulu.66" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A> on December 16, 1938, and assumed command of the H.S.C.A.
Brigade, at Fort <A NAME="DeRussy.67" HREF="index.html#DeRussy">DeRussy</A>.

<P>
During the Christmas holidays I received a cable from Dr. <A NAME="Louis.70" HREF="index.html#Louis">Louis</A> <A NAME="Miles.70" HREF="index.html#Miles">Miles</A> stating
that your grandmother was in the hospital with double pneumonia and was in
a critical condition. He sent me a cablegram each day thereafter for three
or four days before she had safely passed the crisis. I learned later that,
as a last resort, he had had flown from <A NAME="Atlanta.74" HREF="index.html#Atlanta">Atlanta</A> some Rabbit serum for pneumonia
that he had just heard of, and that it had probably saved her life. As a
matter of fact it was the first and last time he had ever used this serum
as the new antibiotic drugs were developed shortly afterwards.

<P>
<A NAME="Eleanor.80" HREF="index.html#Eleanor">Eleanor</A> and <A NAME="Shirley.80" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> joined me in July, 1938.

<P>
Lieutenant General C. D. <A NAME="Herron.83" HREF="index.html#Herron">Herron</A> was in command of the Hawaiian Department
during most of my three year tour. He was a very fine officer, with excellent
judgement and a splendid administrator. We became, and have remained, very
good friends.

<P>
I was fully occupied with studies recommending increases in the AA armament
and the installation of an island wide system of AA communications, and with
the location of sites for the Railway guns and the 155mm. guns on hand.

<P>
During my tour the War Department frequently alerted the Department Commander,
directing him to take all steps to be prepared for an attack by the Japanese,
but to avoid any publicity. I may add that at no time did the War Department
ever call off an alert, leaving it entirely up to the Department Commander
when to terminate each alert. As the result of these alerts the Coast Artillery
Antiaircraft and Seacoast troops were actually in their firing positions,
with all ammunition at the batteries and all communications installed, for
about half the time.

<P>
At the time of my arrival the War Plan provided for three phases. In the
1st phase, known as the antisabotage phase, all Coast Artillery troops were
withdrawn from their armament and were placed on guard of the various power,
water and communication installations to protect them from sabotage. In the
2nd phase these troops were returned to man their armament, and the Hawaiian
Division, at <A NAME="Schofield.109" HREF="index.html#Schofield">Schofield</A> Barracks, was to come down and take over the guard
duty at the public service installations.

<P>
I felt strongly that any attack by the Japanese would be made with little
if any warning and that, as such initial attack would be made by sea or by
air, the Coast Artillery and the Antiaircraft Artillery defenses should be
manned completely in the 1st phase of the War Plan. I persuaded General <A NAME="Herron.116" HREF="index.html#Herron">Herron</A>
to have an Exercise in which, under the War Plan (Phase 1) the CAC troops
were on guard duty at the beginning of the Exercise, and in which, during
the night, information was received of an impending attack by morning, necessitating
that Phase 2 of the Plan be put in effect. The confusion and delay in replacing
the CAC personnel with Division troops, and in drawing the ammunition and
installing the AA defenses, was so great the Plan was revised to require
all CAC and AA armament to be manned at once in Phase 1.

<P>
General <A NAME="Herron.126" HREF="index.html#Herron">Herron</A> retired on <A NAME="March.126" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> 31, 1941. Major General <A NAME="Walter.126" HREF="index.html#Walter">Walter</A> C. <A NAME="Short.126" HREF="index.html#Short">Short</A> had
arrived shortly before and took over command of the Department. He brought
with him as a sort of Aide a Major <A NAME="Phillips.128" HREF="index.html#Phillips">Phillips</A>, of the Infantry.

<P>
Shortly after his arrival General Short announced that he was going to revise
the War Plan and that Major Phillips would be in charge of the revision.
The Plan was changed to return to the old antisabotage phase as Phase 1.
This change was made without consulting Colonel <A NAME="Philip.134" HREF="index.html#Philip">Philip</A> <A NAME="Hays.134" HREF="index.html#Hays">Hays</A>, General <A NAME="Herron.134" HREF="index.html#Herron">Herron</A>'s
Chief of Staff, or me, or, to the best of my knowledge and belief, anyone
who had had a part in the formulation of the approved War Plan, which was
the result of the work of some of the ablest Department Commanders in the
service. The new Plan was shortly afterwards forwarded to the War Department
for approval. It is my recollection that no action was taken by the War Department
during the ensuing six months before my tour expired, and I doubt if anyone
in the War Department had given the matter enough consideration to realize
the nature and importance of the change that had been made in the Plan by
General <A NAME="Short.143" HREF="index.html#Short">Short</A>.

<P>
I believe that General Short was primarily responsible for the fact that
no Antiaircraft Artillery was manned at the time of the attack, on December
7th, 1941, on <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.148" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>. I also believe, however, that the War Department
was at fault in not having advised General Short as to the seriousness of
the situation, in not definitely alerting him, in that it had made a practice
of alerting the Department Commander frequently without ever advising him
when to revert to normal conditions, and in that it had not disapproved the
change in the War Plan submitted by General <A NAME="Short.153" HREF="index.html#Short">Short</A>.

<P>
We all enjoyed our tour of duty at Fort <A NAME="DeRussy.156" HREF="index.html#DeRussy">DeRussy</A>. I recall several incidents
during this period.

<P>
<A NAME="Shirley.160" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> was taking singing lessons from Mrs. <A NAME="Warren.160" HREF="index.html#Warren">Warren</A>, an excellent teacher
who each year put on a recital in <A NAME="Honolulu.161" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A>. In 1940 it was called "Melody
Land" and was a reproduction, in part, of a famous musical comedy of some
years past. Shirley took the part of the leading lady. Her mother had had
made for her a beautiful blue, billowy dress, and I shall always remember
what a beautiful picture she made as she made her entry. She stole the show.
A few days later she was approached by a <A NAME="Hollywood.166" HREF="index.html#Hollywood">Hollywood</A> movie official who was
visiting in Honolulu and who had attended the "Melody Lane" performance,
who asked her if she would be interested in coming to Hollywood for a screen
test. He assured her that he had no doubt but that, with proper training,
she could become a star.

<P>
A month or so later she was approached by the Manager of the largest TV theater
in <A NAME="Honolulu.174" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A>, who told her that each year the various civic clubs and ministers
of the city combined to give a "Mother's Day" celebration, which was held
in his theater and which was largely attended. He said also that he usually
had two solos sung during the performance, one by a soprano and one by a
tenor or baritone, that he had attended the "Melody Lane" performance, and
that he would like to get her to sing the soprano solo on Mother's Day. We
talked it over and decided that the experience of singing before an entirely
strange audience might be advantageous to her, so she agreed. On Mother's
Day we slipped into the back row of seats to watch the performance. When
the proper time came <A NAME="Shirley.183" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> came out on stage and sang her song -- very
well indeed I thought. She withdrew from the stage almost in tears because
there had been no applause. The Manager hastened to explain that the performance
was in the nature of a religious one and that no one ever applauded. He insisted
that she had done well and that she should sing an encore. She came out again,
very hesitantly, and sang her encore. Throughout the singing the audience
was perfectly quiet. Upon its completion there was a short pause, then some
one applauded, and then the entire audience gave her long and enthusiastic
applause. The Manager saw her some months later and said: "I have been in
the theatrical business nearly all my life. The spontaneous applause of that
audience on Mother's Day was the most remarkable tribute to a singer that
I have ever seen."

<P>
There was one other event during this period that, I am sure, it will not
bore you to hear about.

<P>
In the summer of 1940, when your mother was a little over nineteen years
old, your grandmother came to me one day and told me that she (<A NAME="Shirley.202" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A>) wanted
to marry Lieutenant <A NAME="Eubank.203" HREF="index.html#Eubank">Eubank</A>. My reaction was probably that of practically
every father since the institution of marriage was first inaugurated. I was
at a loss for words, but I finally managed to reply that the idea was absurd
-- that she was entirely too young to think of getting married. We discussed
the matter at length during the ensuing days. She held to the view that it
was Shirley's life and happiness that was involved, and the decision was
rightly hers to make. I eventually concurred, with the understanding that
she would take <A NAME="Shirley.210" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> back to the States for a while and give her an opportunity
to see again the three or four boys who had been especially keen about her,
and find out if she was still sure that it was Lieutenant <A NAME="Eubank.212" HREF="index.html#Eubank">Eubank</A> that she
wanted to marry.

<P>
They made the trip, visiting <A NAME="Summerville.216" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A>, <A NAME="New York.216" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> and <A NAME="West Point.216" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> (and incidentally
taking in the Expositions at <A NAME="San Francisco.217" HREF="index.html#San Francisco">San Francisco</A> and New York). <A NAME="Shirley.217" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> never had
the slightest doubt in the matter, and all concerned began to make plans
for the wedding. They were married on June 28, 1941, in the Cathedral in
<A NAME="Honolulu.220" HREF="index.html#Honolulu">Honolulu</A> by the <A NAME="Bishop.220" HREF="index.html#Bishop">Bishop</A> of Honolulu. She was a beautiful bride, and my emotions
as I marched down the aisle with her on my arm were a mixture of pride and
regret. The wedding was followed by a reception (for some 500 people) at
the Pavilion Club at Fort <A NAME="DeRussy.223" HREF="index.html#DeRussy">DeRussy</A>. After a short honeymoon at <A NAME="Haliewa.223" HREF="index.html#Haliewa">Haliewa</A> the
Eubanks returned to Fort DeRussy and occupied a very nice set of quarters
there for some six or eight months, when <A NAME="Perry.225" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A>, having completed his three
year tour, was ordered to Fort <A NAME="Hancock.226" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A>, <A NAME="New Jersey.226" HREF="index.html#New Jersey">New Jersey</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="Shirley.229" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A> had never -- well hardly ever -- boiled an egg or made a bed, and
I was not without some misgivings as to just how well she would be able to
run a house of her own. When I observe the five wonderful children that she
has managed to bring up so successfully, practically without a nurse or a
maid, I realized that my misgivings were based upon the fact that I did not
at the time appreciate the resourcefulness, the resilience, the determination,
the adaptability and the ingenuity of an "Army Brat."
