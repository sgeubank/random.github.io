A5. A CODE TRANSACTION
</H3>
<HR>

<P>
Referring to the fact that one of the principal objectives of the espionage
service was to break the enemy's Naval code, Lt. <A NAME="Solbert.21" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A> told us of one incident,
which i shall call

<P>
A CODE TRANSACTION

<HR>

The Germans had, in some way, learned that our Navy was going to put in effect
on a certain date a new Code, and they had sent out word to that effect to
all their agents, with the instructions that the securing of a copy of this
new Code was a matter of the utmost importance, and that any agent who accomplished
this task would be ordered to <A NAME="Berlin.33" HREF="index.html#Berlin">Berlin</A> and be decorated by the <A NAME="Fuehrer.33" HREF="index.html#Fuehrer">Fuehrer</A> himself.

<P>
Lt. <A NAME="Solbert.36" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A>, learning of these instructions from one of his own agents in
the <A NAME="German.37" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> Embassy, decided to do something to decrease the pressure being
put upon the German agents to procure a copy of the new Code.

<P>
Some weeks earlier an American submarine had been sunk in the North Sea and
in the debris washed up on the <A NAME="Swedish.42" HREF="index.html#Swedish">Swedish</A> shore was a copy o an old, obsolete
Code Book. <A NAME="Solbert.43" HREF="index.html#Solbert">Solbert</A> secured this book, had the cover and the first pages removed
and new pages printed to substitute for them, these new pages carrying the
name and date of the new Code, had a new cover put on, soaked the whole in
water until it was all equally water soaked and discolored. He then planted
this book in with the debris from the sunken submarine and arranged that
it should be found by a <A NAME="German.48" HREF="index.html#German">German</A>, who delivered it to the German Legation.

<P>
He was much interested to see copies of the cablegram from the German War
Office (which his agent had obtained) announcing that the new Code had been
secured, and that the fortunate finder had just been given a cross of some
kind by the <A NAME="Fuehrer.54" HREF="index.html#Fuehrer">Fuehrer</A> in person.

<P>
The War Office did not announce it when it eventually discovered that it
had been made the victim of a clever hoax by someone in the U. S. Legation.
