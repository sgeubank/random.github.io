4. His Marriage
</H3>
<HR>
It was about this time that he met 
<A href=Anette.gif> Miss <A NAME="Anetta.19" HREF="index.html#Anetta">Anetta</A> <A NAME="Goolsby.19" HREF="index.html#Goolsby">Goolsby</A></A>,
an event of some importance to us all, as otherwise I would
not be writing this and you would not be reading it. She was the oldest daughter
of <A NAME="Andrew.22" HREF="index.html#Andrew">Andrew</A> <A NAME="Jackson.22" HREF="index.html#Jackson">Jackson</A> Goolsby, a lifelong resident of <A NAME="Oxford.22" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>. Before the Civil
War he had been quite wealthy, owning a number of farms and a considerable
number of slaves. During the War, he, apparently confident of the success
of the <A NAME="Confederacy.25" HREF="index.html#Confederacy">Confederacy</A>, had sold several of his farms for <A NAME="Confederate.25" HREF="index.html#Confederate">Confederate</A> money,
which, of course, became worthless after the War. He, however, was comfortably
well off, and his three daughters had been given what was, in those days,
considered to be an excellent education at Dr. <A NAME="Slack.28" HREF="index.html#Slack">Slack</A>'s Female Academy, at
<A NAME="Pontitoc.29" HREF="index.html#Pontitoc">Pontitoc</A>, Miss. Of course he fell in love with her. However, with his mother
and three sisters to support, he could see no prospect of marriage for him,
and he decided that it would be best for all concerned if he saw as little
of Miss <A NAME="Anetta.32" HREF="index.html#Anetta">Anetta</A> as possible.<P>So, on the completion of his studies at the
University, he went to St. <A NAME="Louis.33" HREF="index.html#Louis">Louis</A> to attend what was then known, I believe,
as the <A NAME="Missouri.34" HREF="index.html#Missouri">Missouri</A> Medical College, and which was an excellent Medical School.
Upon his graduation, in about 1879, he was invited by one of his professors,
a prominent gynecologist in St. Louis, to come in his office as his assistant.
This was a flattering offer for a young doctor, but after careful consideration,
he decided that, for various reasons (mostly concerned with 
<A href=Anette.gif> Miss <A NAME="Nettie.39" HREF="index.html#Nettie">Nettie</A> <A NAME="Goolsby.39" HREF="index.html#Goolsby">Goolsby</A></A>)
his future lay in <A NAME="Mississippi.40" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A>. He was fortified in this decision by the fact
that, in the meantime, his mother and one sister had died and his other two
sisters had married, so that he no longer had to concern himself about their
support. So he came back to <A NAME="Oxford.43" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>. It was the normal procedure in those
days for a doctor, upon graduating, to begin his practice as a country doctor,
with the view of acquiring a s much experience as possible as a general practitioner
in as short a time as possible.<P>He decided to go into practice at La <A NAME="Fayette.46" HREF="index.html#Fayette">Fayette</A>
Springs, a small country town in La Fayette County, near Oxford. He also
made another decision -- to ask Miss <A NAME="Nettie.48" HREF="index.html#Nettie">Nettie</A> to marry him ( a decision that,
I imagine, was not entirely unanticipated by her). She, with a full realization
of the hardships that would undoubtedly be hers as the wife of a young country
doctor, consented. And so they were married in 1881 and set up home on a
small farm at <A NAME="LaFayette.52" HREF="index.html#LaFayette">LaFayette</A> Springs (with an office in the yard), where I was
born on November 8th, 1882.<P>My father was a great admirer of L.Q.C. <A NAME="Lamar.53" HREF="index.html#Lamar">Lamar</A>,
(<A NAME="Lucius.54" HREF="index.html#Lucius">Lucius</A> <A NAME="Quintus.54" HREF="index.html#Quintus">Quintus</A> <A NAME="Cincinnatus.54" HREF="index.html#Cincinnatus">Cincinnatus</A> Lamar), a distinguished Mississippian, who had
served as a Senator, <A NAME="Cabinet.55" HREF="index.html#Cabinet">Cabinet</A> Officer, and Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court,and, somewhat to my future embarrassment, they decided to name me after
him, substituting the name <A NAME="Fulton.57" HREF="index.html#Fulton">Fulton</A> for Lucius -- after Chancellor Fulton,
of the University of <A NAME="Mississippi.58" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A>, who had become a great friend of father's
while he was at the University.
