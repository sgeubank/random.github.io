A3. SOME EARLY DAYS IN THE ARMY

</H3>
<HR>

When I was a 2nd Lieutenant of Field Artillery at Fort <A NAME="Riley.20" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>, <A NAME="Kansas.20" HREF="index.html#Kansas">Kansas</A>, in
1906, Major (later Major General) <A NAME="Ely.21" HREF="index.html#Ely">Ely</A> D. <A NAME="Hoyle.21" HREF="index.html#Hoyle">Hoyle</A> was in command of the Artillery
subpost. Mrs. Hoyle, (one of the <A NAME="DeRussy.22" HREF="index.html#DeRussy">DeRussy</A> sisters, of Fortress <A NAME="Monroe.22" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>, all
of whom were famous for their beauty and their charm), kept open house for
the Lieutenants and the young ladies of the garrison, and I spent many delightful
hours as their guest at dinners or informal parties. Often, after dinner,
when the young officers were sitting in their den having coffee with Major
Hoyle, he would tell us stories about frontier days in the army.

<P>
I recall one such story -- which I think could perhaps, with the proper padding,
serve as the basis for a TV Western series, and to which I shall, to save
time and effort, give the quite colorless title of

<P>
SOME EARLY DAYS IN THE ARMY

<P>
This story concerns a tall, lank, raw boned, silent, <A NAME="Tennessee.38" HREF="index.html#Tennessee">Tennessee</A> mountaineer
whose name I have long forgotten but which I shall now assume to have been
<A NAME="James.40" HREF="index.html#James">James</A> <A NAME="Wilson.40" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>. He had just enough education to be able to teach a small country
school in a small town in eastern Tennessee.

<P>
One day in the late 70's he received in the mail a formal looking envelope
addressed to him, which, upon opening, was found to contain a letter from
someone who signed it as the Adjutant General of the Army, advising him that
he had been commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of <A NAME="Cavalry.47" HREF="index.html#Cavalry">Cavalry</A> and directing him to
take the oath of office and to proceed to Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.48" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, <A NAME="Texas.48" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A> and report
to the Commanding Officer for duty.

<P>
<A NAME="James.52" HREF="index.html#James">James</A> <A NAME="Wilson.52" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> knew nothing about the army. He knew no one of sufficient influence
or importance to have been able to help him in such an undertaking, and the
thought of securing a commission in the army had never occurred to him. He
had no idea whatever as to why he had been sent such a letter, but as it
showed correctly his name and address he decided that he would comply with
it and see what it was all about. (As a matter of fact, it developed some
months later that the letter had been intended for a young man of the same
name as himself, who lived in another town of a name very similar to that
in which <A NAME="Wilson.60" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> lived.)

<P>
In due course of time he reached <A NAME="San Antonio.63" HREF="index.html#San Antonio">San Antonio</A> and reported to the Commanding
Officer, Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.64" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, as ordered. He was assigned quarters in the <A NAME="Bachelor.64" HREF="index.html#Bachelor">Bachelor</A>
Building. He kept very much to himself, never told anyone how he had happened
to get his commission, and was assigned as understudy for several weeks to
one of the Lieutenants. At the end of this period he was deemed to be sufficiently
instructed to let him go on as Officer of the Day.

<P>
In the afternoon, while he was in the Guard House, the Sergeant of the Guard
came to him and informed him that word had just been received that several
soldiers were raising a disturbance in one of the cheap bar rooms which,
from that time until today have surrounded the Post.

<P>
<A NAME="Wilson.77" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> had received no specific instruction as to what he was supposed to
do in a case of this kind, and he didn't care to ask anybody. He buckled
on his six shooter and said to the Sergeant: "Come on with me and we'll arrest
these men and bring them back to the Post."

<P>
When the two of them entered the bar room, the soldiers were talking in a
loud and drunken manner and were ordering more drinks. Lieutenant <A NAME="Wilson.84" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>
looked the situation over for a minute or two and then told the soldiers
to quiet down and come with him back to the Post. At this point the bar tender,
who was a rough customer, took one look at the new Lieutenant, and then told
him, in no uncertain terms, to get out of there and to let the soldiers alone.
Lieutenant Wilson replied that he was the Officer of the Day and that he
was going to take the soldiers back to the Post. The bar tender, in a rage,
pulled a revolver from under the counter and started to point it at the officer.
Before he could aim his weapon, however, Lt. <A NAME="Wilson.92" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> had drawn his own gun
and had killed the bar tender. With the soldiers in tow he then returned
to the Post and reported to the C. O. what had occurred. In the subsequent
investigation he was found to have acted in self defense.

<P>
Several months elapsed after this incident and Lieutenant Wilson was again
on duty as Officer of the Day. The C. O. sent for him and said: "Lieutenant,
I have just received word that two noted desperadoes (giving their names
and descriptions) are on such and such a road, approaching <A NAME="San Antonio.101" HREF="index.html#San Antonio">San Antonio</A>, about
12 miles from town. I have received orders from the Department Commander
to arrest these men and to bring them to Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.103" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> dead or alive. I
shall turn this job over to you as Officer of the Day, and I shall provide
you with any assistance that you may require. Let me know as soon as you
can what detail you desire to accompany you."

<P>
Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.109" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> replied: "I don't want any detail, Sir."

<P>
After some discussion, the Colonel, in dismissing him, said: "Well, Lieutenant,
you don;t have to take a detail unless you want to. But understand clearly
that the responsibility of bringing them in is yours and that I shall hold
you responsible for any failure to do so."

<P>
A few minutes later Lt. <A NAME="Wilson.118" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> was observed to come out of his quarters,
dressed in cowboy clothes, and to mount his horse, equipped with a cowboy
saddle, and ride away.

<P>
While the Colonel was at dinner that evening, the maid announced that Lieutenant
Wilson was outside and wished to speak to the Colonel. The Colonel was much
annoyed at being interrupted at dinner but he went out. Lieutenant <A NAME="Wilson.125" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>
saluted and said: "Sir, I have these two men outside and I would like to
know what to do with them." The C. O., still more annoyed, said: "Take them
down to the Guard House and lock them up" and started back to his dinner.
Lieutenant Wilson caused him to defer his departure somewhat, however, when
he said: "I don't think that would be a very good idea, Sir. You see, Sir,
they are both dead."

<P>
Word as to what had happened was not slow in passing around the garrison
but Lieut.. <A NAME="Wilson.135" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> declined to discuss the matter with any of his messmates.
It was some months later before he told one of the Lieutenants just what
had happened.

<P>
He had ridden out on the road to a point where he could observe from cover
any riders approaching <A NAME="San Antonio.141" HREF="index.html#San Antonio">San Antonio</A>. When the two riders came up and passed
him he observed them carefully and satisfied himself as to their identities.
He let them get about a quarter of a mile ahead of him, when he started following
them. They turned around several times to look at him, but he did not gain
distance on them, and they gradually ceased bothering about him as he slowly
gained on them. Finally he approached to within a short distance from them,
and he rode along, without gaining further, until the two men approached
a large mud hole in the road. At this instant <A NAME="Wilson.148" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> spurred his horse in
between the two men. They were taken by surprise, but they both reached for
their guns. Before either could draw Wilson had a gun in each hand and had
shot them both dead. He then tied the bodies onto their horses and led them
back to the Post.

<P>
A few months later Lt. <A NAME="Wilson.155" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>'s squadron was ordered to Fort <A NAME="Ringold.155" HREF="index.html#Ringold">Ringold</A>, <A NAME="Texas.155" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>,
to relieve another squadron that had been stationed there for some time.
Fort Ringold, on the <A NAME="Rio Grande.157" HREF="index.html#Rio Grande">Rio Grande</A>, was then a very isolated post. The railroad
did not extend that far south and access to the post from the north was by
way either of a horse drawn vehicle or by horseback.

<P>
Once a month the Army Paymaster from Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.162" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> brought down the pay
for the Fort <A NAME="Ringold.163" HREF="index.html#Ringold">Ringold</A> troops in an Army buckboard. He was a cocky sort of
individual; his knowledge of human nature was not very profound, and his
judgement was not infallible. He prided himself on his ability as a hunter,
and it was his practice to bring his gun along with him, and to take advantage
of the very fine bird shooting on the Fort Ringold reservation, after he
had finished paying the troops. He generally arrived the day preceding payday
and left the day following payday.

<P>
On the particular occasion I have in mind, after supper a number of the post
officers (including Lt. <A NAME="Wilson.173" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>) were gathered in the room of the Canteen,
which in that day was the equivalent of the present day Officer's Club, and
the Paymaster was reading to them some of the news in the latest <A NAME="San Antonio.175" HREF="index.html#San Antonio">San Antonio</A>
paper, which he had brought down to them. One of the items in the paper described
in some detail the hold up of an Army Paymaster, in <A NAME="California.177" HREF="index.html#California">California</A>, by a lone
highwayman, who had escaped, unharmed, with all the money.

<P>
The Paymaster took occasion to comment at some length on this occurrence
and concluded by saying that he considered that the other Paymaster was a
coward to be held up by one man. There was some discussion on the subject,
and Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.184" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> told the Paymaster that he did not agree with him. He said:
"The highwayman in this case was apparently an old hand at the game. He was
probably a murderer. In any case he would probably not have hesitated to
shoot the Paymaster if he had thought it necessary or desirable to do so.
Under the circumstances, I think the Paymaster would have been a fool to
offer resistance when the outlaw had the drop on him." The Paymaster stated
that he strongly disagreed with the Lieutenant; that, in his opinion, the
Paymaster should be court martialled for cowardice. He added that the man
did not live who, single handed, could hold him up and get away with it.
This concluded the discussion on this particular item.

<P>
The next afternoon the Paymaster put on his fancy hunting clothes, and, taking
his gun, he took off on a road leading through the Reservation towards an
area where the shooting was reported to be especially good.

<P>
When he was several miles from the Post, as he made a sharp turn in the road,
a man, wearing a handkerchief as a mask, stepped out in front of him, aimed
his <A NAME="Winchester.203" HREF="index.html#Winchester">Winchester</A> (or its that day equivalent) at him, and said, in a voice
that was quite devoid of uncertainty: "Drop your gun," then, in turn, "Take
off your pants," "Take off your coat", "Take off your underclothes." The
Paymaster complied. Then the man said: "Now you turn around and walk back
to the Post. And if you look around once before you get over the hill, I'll
put a bullet through your belly." The Paymaster complied.

<P>
Upon reaching the edge of the Post he got behind a tree, so that his unusual
uniform (or more precisely, his lack of uniform) would not so easily be observed,
and called out until some one came out to see what was the matter.

<P>
The Paymaster gave a very detailed account of how he had been held up by
two highwaymen, who had robbed him of his gun and of his clothes. The C.
O. was much concerned that bandits should have staged a holdup on the Reservation
and he turned out the command to establish road blocks and to try to capture
the outlaws. By the time it became dark, no sign of the bandits had been
seen and the troops were recalled.

<P>
Most of the officers gathered in the Canteen, and were discussing the events
of the day. While the discussion was at its height, the door was opened and
a bundle was quickly slid across the floor. It contained all the Paymaster's
clothes and his gun.

<P>
It was noted afterwards that Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.230" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> had not been among the officers
assembled in the Canteen. There was no question in the minds of any of the
officers present but that Lieut. Wilson had been the one who had held up
the Paymaster, and it was generally agreed that if the Paymaster had offered
any resistance he would have been shot.

<P>
Some time later Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.237" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> was transferred to Fort <A NAME="Riley.237" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>. A few months
after his arrival he got into an argument with a man and shot him, killing
him. He was tried by Court Martial, convicted of murder and sentenced by
the Court to death. Action by the War Department on the record of trial hung
fire for six months or more, Lt. Wilson being held in confinement during
this time. (It later developed that the Judge Advocate General had had much
difficulty in deciding what action to take on the record, in view of some
of its defects.

<P>
Finally one day the Commanding Officer, Fort <A NAME="Riley.247" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>, received a telegram from
the War Department stating that due to certain serious legal irregularities
in the record the finding and sentence had been disapproved, and directing
that Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.250" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A> be restored to duty.

<P>
The Colonel had Lt. Wilson brought in, under guard, to his office. He communicated
the contents of the telegram to the Lieutenant, and then added a few remarks
to the effect that he hoped Lt. Wilson realized how narrowly he had escaped
the death penalty and that he hoped he had learned his lesson, etc., etc.

<P>
Lieut. <A NAME="Wilson.259" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>, who had entered the room not knowing whether he was to live
or to die, had stood expressionless during the interview. Upon its conclusion
he had said only: "Is that all, Sir?" Upon the reply in the affirmative he
saluted and withdrew without comment of any kind.

<P>
I asked Major <A NAME="Hoyle.265" HREF="index.html#Hoyle">Hoyle</A> what had happened to Lieut. Wilson afterwards. He told
me that he had resigned from the army about a year later.

<P>
Perhaps he decided that the Army life was too dull and uninteresting for
him and he sought more congenial work.

<P>
If so, I have often wondered just what kind of work it was.
