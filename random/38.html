38. IN COMMAND OF THE NORTHEAST SECTOR.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I arrived in <A NAME="Boston.22" HREF="index.html#Boston">Boston</A> and assumed command of the Northeast Sector on May 15,
1944. This Sector extended from the <A NAME="Canadian.23" HREF="index.html#Canadian">Canadian</A> Border to include <A NAME="Hancock.23" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A>, New
Jersey. In addition to any mobile troops that might be assigned to the Sector
it included all Coast Artillery installations within the area.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
While in command of the Sector I particularly concerned myself with training
the Coast Artillery personnel to man the old 3" AA fixed guns and the new
40 mm. guns in the Harbor Defenses. In cooperation with the Navy Motor Boat
Training Center in <A NAME="Narragansett.31" HREF="index.html#Narragansett">Narragansett</A> Bay, a considerable number of Joint Exercises
were conducted in a number of Harbor Defenses, in which Motor Torpedo Boats
endeavored to enter the harbor by evading the defending radar and searchlight
installations.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I was also particularly interested in emphasizing the training in the maintenance
and operation of the submarine mine installations in the various Harbor Defenses,
and, later, in the supervision of the raising and unloading of the mines
(which, as I remember it, each contained a 2000 pound charge of TNT) and
the shipment of the large amounts of TNT away for permanent storage. It was
very gratifying that this work was completed without a casualty of any kind.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The Headquarters of the Northeast Sector was inactivated as of May 15, 1945,
and after a leave of absence I was ordered to report to the Headquarters
of the Army Ground Forces, at the War College in <A NAME="Washington.47" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
During my service of about a year in <A NAME="Boston.50" HREF="index.html#Boston">Boston</A>, through the courtesy of the
<A NAME="Harvard.51" HREF="index.html#Harvard">Harvard</A> Club, I lived at that Club. All the leading Clubs in Boston extended
honorary membership to me and my relations with the people of Boston (including
Governor <A NAME="Saltonstall.53" HREF="index.html#Saltonstall">Saltonstall</A>) were most pleasant.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall one thing that was depressing. There had recently been constructed
within the Sector several 16" Batteries of the most modern type. All the
armament had been received. The War Department, however, directed that this
armament, which was stored in the Batteries, be not mounted.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
This marked the beginning of the end of the Coast Artillery , and the new
16" guns were later cut up and sold as junk.
