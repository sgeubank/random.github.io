1. FOREWORD

<HR, align=left>
With my 72nd birthday rapidly approaching, I suppose
it is but natural that I should, by now, have developed some sort of a mental,
as well as an optical presbyopia. For I find that I am inclined more than
ever before to recall to mind recollections of what, to you, would doubtless
seem to be the very distant past.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In turning over some of the early pages
in my book of memories I have been brought to realize, perhaps for the first
time, how very little I really know about my own grandparents, and, in fact,
perhaps how very little most people really know about their grandparents
-- what kind of people they really were, what they thought about, what they
sought to accomplish, and, in general, how and where they spent their lives.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In
my own case, the fact that I know practically nothing about the lives of
my grandparents is attributable to several factors. Thus my paternal grandparents
both died before I was born, my parents moved from <A NAME="Mississippi.30" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> (where both
my father's and my mother's families lived) to <A NAME="Arkansas.31" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> when I was too young
to remember any of their relatives, and during the life of my own parents
I was never sufficiently interested in the matter to appreciate how much
they could have told me about their forefathers (and foremothers).<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is
quite possible, if not probable, that you also will not be particularly interested
in such matters until you are much older than you are now, and that by that
time it will be too late to ask your grandparents about these (or any other)
things. Indeed it may well be that by that time you will have but a very
indistinct recollection, if any, of these grandparents.<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is in the hope
that when you too reach the age when you will become interested in such matters
you may possibly find it somewhat interesting to read these pages, that I
am taking advantage of the fact that, for the first time in my life, I have
some spare time on my hands, to set down, in a very sketchy and informal
manner, some of the things that you might possibly have wished to ask about
had you thought about it in time.<P ALIGN=LEFT>It is not my purpose to attempt to discuss
any matters of National policy, either military or International, nor do
I seek to attach undue importance, in recounting them, to any of the incidents
of my life, which has been a singularly uneventful -- though a thoroughly
happy -- one.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I realize, furthermore, that I have doubtless reached that
time in life which <A NAME="Disraeli.50" HREF="index.html#Disraeli">Disraeli</A> once referred to as the anecdotage. I notice
that it now takes very slight encouragement for me to launch forth into some
reminiscence or other which is doubtless much less interesting to the hearer
than it is to me. Moreover I am inclined to believe that it is one of the
inalienable rights (or rites) of a grandfather to reminisce to his grandchildren,
and that the grandchildren are sometimes interested enough (or polite enough)
to ask their grandfathers to do so.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Realizing that my age and the exigencies
of your life in the Army may, in combination, operate to minimize, or to
prevent entirely any favorable opportunities for such a situation to arise,
I plan to recount also in these pages some of the stories or incidents that
I probably would, if the opportunity had presented itself, have included
in my reminiscences to you. Those items will be included, not because they
have anything to do with any of us, but in the hope that they may perhaps
be of some interest to you.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I plan to make a copy of these pages for each
of you -- to be kept here in <A NAME="Summerville.64" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A> until you are older, and some day
to be given to you if you so desire.
