30. ON THE GENERAL STAFF, HDQRS. VIIIth CORPS AREA.

</H3>
<HR>


<P>
We arrived at Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.22" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> August 9th, 1928. We were assigned Quarters
#11, Staff Post, a very comfortable stone building, which we enjoyed throughout
our stay.

<P>
I was assigned as G-1, although, under General <A NAME="Lassiter.27" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A> I was, at various
times Acting G-3 or G-4. I was Acting G-3 in <A NAME="March.28" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> -- April, 1929, during
the <A NAME="Escobar.29" HREF="index.html#Escobar">Escobar</A> Revolution in <A NAME="Mexico.29" HREF="index.html#Mexico">Mexico</A>. This Revolution was of considerably more
importance to the <A NAME="United States.30" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> than was generally recognized by the public
at that time. The combined Rebel and Federal troops comprised the largest
body of well-equipped <A NAME="Mexican.32" HREF="index.html#Mexican">Mexican</A> troops (some 30000) ever concentrated near
our southwest border. The operations consisted chiefly of fighting to sieze
or to hold the Border cities, the attackers in some cases being Federals
and in others being Rebels. In either case the Infantry and Artillery fire
fell, in part, across the Border and endangered American life and property.
Similarly airplanes used, for the first time in Mexican revolutions, even
when over Mexican territory, dropped bombs that landed in American territory.
Approximately 3000 troops from the 2nd Division (at Ft. Sam <A NAME="Houston.39" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>), the
7th <A NAME="Cavalry.40" HREF="index.html#Cavalry">Cavalry</A> (Ft. <A NAME="Bliss.40" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A>) and the 10th Cavalry (Ft. <A NAME="Huachuca.40" HREF="index.html#Huachuca">Huachuca</A>), and 12 Attack
planes from Ft. <A NAME="Crockett.41" HREF="index.html#Crockett">Crockett</A> and 6 Observation planes from Ft. <A NAME="Sam Houston.41" HREF="index.html#Sam Houston">Sam Houston</A> were
moved to positions along the Border, and General <A NAME="Cocheu.42" HREF="index.html#Cocheu">Cocheu</A>, in command, was
given definite instructions to shoot down any <A NAME="Mexican.43" HREF="index.html#Mexican">Mexican</A> planes that dropped
bombs on American territory and to take any steps that might, after reasonable
warning, be necessary to protect American life and property from any class
of ground fire.

<P>
The nature of the new problems presented and the fact that at times the situation
became tense, even threatening to result in combined Federal and rebel attack
against the <A NAME="United States.51" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>, resulted in a dangerous situation. General <A NAME="Lassiter.51" HREF="index.html#Lassiter">Lassiter</A>'s
handling of the situation throughout was masterly, and my G-3 experience
under him was most interesting and instructive.

<P>
The pleasure of our stay at Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.56" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A> was greatly marred by the fact
that <A NAME="Shirley.57" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A>, then about ten years old, was seriously bitten by an <A NAME="Airedale.57" HREF="index.html#Airedale">Airedale</A>
dog belonging to Colonel <A NAME="George.58" HREF="index.html#George">George</A> P. <A NAME="Tyner.58" HREF="index.html#Tyner">Tyner</A>, then Corps Area Chief of Staff.
Some 36 stitches in her face were necessary, and her eventual recovery with
almost no scars was due to the great skill as a Plastic Surgeon of Colonel
H. <A NAME="Wellington.61" HREF="index.html#Wellington">Wellington</A> <A NAME="Jones.61" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A>, Medical Corps, the Chief of Surgery in the large hospital
(later <A NAME="Brooks.62" HREF="index.html#Brooks">Brooks</A> General Hospital), who personally operated on her.

<P>
One pleasant memory of our stay there is that of an automobile trip, together
with about half a dozen friends, that we took to <A NAME="Monterey.66" HREF="index.html#Monterey">Monterey</A>, <A NAME="Mexico.66" HREF="index.html#Mexico">Mexico</A>, over the
new road which was later extended to Mexico City and beyond.
