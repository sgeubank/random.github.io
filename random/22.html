22. RECOLLECTIONS OF GENERAL MARCH

</H3>
<HR align=left>
(Note: In February, 1958, I received a letter from Mr. E. M. <A NAME="Coffman.19" HREF="index.html#Coffman">Coffman</A>, History
Department, <A NAME="Memphis.20" HREF="index.html#Memphis">Memphis</A> State University, Memphis, <A NAME="Tenn.20" HREF="index.html#Tenn">Tenn</A>., stating that he had,
for some time, been engaged in research preparatory to writing a biography
of General <A NAME="March.22" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, and requesting me, in view of my long association with
him, to give him some notes on General March. I was glad to do so, and I
shall insert here those notes, which, in general, cover matters in regard
to which Mr. Coffman had asked specific questions, in the hope that these
notes may possibly be of some interest to you.)

<P>
General <A NAME="March.29" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, having been ordered back from <A NAME="France.29" HREF="index.html#France">France</A> by Secretary <A NAME="Baker.29" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A> for
that purpose, assumed the duty of acting Chief of Staff on March 4th, 1918.
He became Chief of Staff on May 20th, 1918.

<P>
Colonel P. P. <A NAME="Bishop.34" HREF="index.html#Bishop">Bishop</A> (Coast Artillery Corps), General Staff, was shortly
afterward designated as Secretary of the General Staff, and, upon his recommendation,
I was relieved from duty with the War College Division and assigned to duty
as assistant to the Secretary of the General Staff. Upon the organization
of the Personnel Branch, in September, 1918 General <A NAME="March.38" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> promoted Colonel
Bishop to the grade of Brigadier General and assigned him to the important
duty of organizing and operating that Branch. At the same time he appointed
me, on September 12, 1918, Secretary of the General Staff, and I remained
on this duty until August, 1921. I had never seen nor served under General
March before he became Acting Chief of Staff.

<P>
General <A NAME="March.46" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> came back from <A NAME="France.46" HREF="index.html#France">France</A> with the belief that the most fundamental
necessity was that the shipment of troops to France should be vastly increased
and should have priority over everything else. To this end he immediately
began to effect a reorganization of the General Staff and of the War Department.
The steps taken in this connection are set forth in some detail in his Report
to the Secretary of War, 1919. (the preparation of which was one of my responsibilities
as Secretary of the General Staff), and in his book, "The Nation at War."
These reorganizations were far reaching in their effects and were of paramount
importance in the accomplishment of the tremendous military program.

<P>
Among the more important of the decisions or actions for which General <A NAME="March.57" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>
was, in my opinion, personally and individually responsible were the following,
listed roughly in chronological order:

<P>
1. The adoption, by the Secretary of War, by the <A NAME="President.62" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> and by the Congress
of the 80 division program as proposed by him in July, 1918.

<P>
2. The consolidation of all the Regular Army, National Guard, and National
Army forces into one army, the <A NAME="United States.67" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> Army, and the adoption of promotion
by selection. (G. O. #73, August 7, 1918)

<P>
3. The reorganization of the General Staff under G. O. #80, August 26, 1918.
This order definitely charged the Chief of Staff with the responsibility
for the execution of the Army program, and delegated to him the authority
commensurate with that responsibility. It prescribed four Divisions of the
General Staff: (1) Operations, (2) Military Intelligence, (3) Purchase, Storage
and Traffic, and (4) War Plans.

<P>
4. Through his efforts as representative of the War Department with the War
Industries Board, the Shipping Board, the Shipping Control Committee, and
other similar agencies, he was able to secure the tremendous amount of shipping
that was required for the transportation of troops and supplies to <A NAME="France.82" HREF="index.html#France">France</A>
under the 80 Division program, and which, without his personal efforts would
undoubtedly not have been made available.

<P>
5. The complete divorcement of Army appointments, promotions, and assignments
from all political influence, for the first time in the history of all our
wars.

<P>
6. The organization of the Personnel Branch (of the Operations Division of
the General Staff, by G. O. #86, September 18, 1918, to have control over
the appointment, promotion, transfer and assignment of all the commissioned
personnel of the Army. Consideration had been given to the selection of some
prominent civilian to head up the Commissioned Personnel of the Army; General
<A NAME="March.97" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was primarily responsible for the decision that this new agency should
be under Army personnel.

<P>
7. The plan for the demobilization of the Army by complete military organizations
in order of their availability for discharge, instead of by individual soldier
whenever work was available for him. The latter mentioned system was that
undertaken in Great <A NAME="Britain.104" HREF="index.html#Britain">Britain</A> and found to require extensive modification in
practice. It was the basis of a plan recommended by Assistant Secretary of
War <A NAME="Keppel.106" HREF="index.html#Keppel">Keppel</A> and other close advisors of the Secretary of War. For the conception
of the plan actually used, with great success, in this country, General <A NAME="March.107" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>,
in my opinion, was personally responsible.

<P>
General March generally reached his office before 8 o'clock, the opening
time. He had a sandwich and a glass of milk brought in for lunch at his desk;
he went back to his quarters at Fort <A NAME="Myer.113" HREF="index.html#Myer">Myer</A> for dinner and returned to his
office, where he remained until midnight or later.

<P>
During all this time he was under extreme tension and pressure. He normally
devoted less than half an hour each day to handling the regular work of the
General Staff. Since, on the average, perhaps 600 papers a day passed through
the office of the Secretary of the General Staff, some account of the way
in which papers were handled may be of interest. The 600 papers referred
to included all studies or action papers submitted by the four Divisions
of the General Staff (except that a large part of the routine papers of the
PS&T and the Military Intelligence Divisions were handled by them through
other than military channels), all communications received that required
action or reply by the General Staff, and probably the greater part of the
numerous letters received by the Secretary of War from other <A NAME="Cabinet.127" HREF="index.html#Cabinet">Cabinet</A> members
(from one of whom, the Attorney General E. <A NAME="Mitchell.128" HREF="index.html#Mitchell">Mitchell</A> <A NAME="Palmer.128" HREF="index.html#Palmer">Palmer</A>, as many as 15
or 20 letters a day were sometimes received on behalf of various individuals,
many of whom were not known to him), members of Congress, or others, and
referred by his office to the office of the Secretary of the General Staff
for draft of reply for the signature of the Secretary of War. Incoming papers
were assigned to the proper General Staff Division and a record system enabled
the whereabouts of each such paper to be ascertained at once whenever this
became necessary. Upon receipt each paper was carefully examined by one of
the assistants to the Secretary of the General Staff, and perhaps 25 or 50
of the most important ones, in addition to those for the signature of the
Secretary of War, were turned over to me. Each of these papers was then carefully
examined by one of my assistants or by me, and out of these papers perhaps
a dozen or less were selected for presentation to the Chief of Staff. I made
it a practice that such notes as were to be used in making this presentation
should be limited to one sheet of a small (about 3" by 5") memorandum pad
per paper.

<P>
Regularly each morning at 11:30 General <A NAME="March.146" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> rang a buzzer on my desk signifying
that he was ready for the presentation of papers. In presenting the papers
orally in turn the salient features of each were stated. In most cases these
covered important details that were of sufficient importance to be brought
to his personal attention as a matter of information. In other cases where
there was considered to be some question as to whether or not the action
proposed to be taken was entirely consistent with his policies, the matter
was submitted to him for decision. He rarely ever took a paper in his hands
to examine it. He listened intently to the presentation, quickly asked several
searching questions if he deemed it necessary, and promptly made his decision
orally. The entire proceeding did not ordinarily require more than 20 or
30 minutes. He made it a practice to initial with an encircled M any paper
that he had personally examined.

<P>
He had a remarkable memory, as is illustrated by one incident that I recall.
At the time when the Liberty engines were just coming into production the
question as to the allocation of the limited number to become available soon
to the Air Service, to the Navy and to the <A NAME="British.164" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> and <A NAME="French.164" HREF="index.html#French">French</A> was a difficult
one. I presented a General Staff study on this matter and, among other things,
I read off to him the figures covering the estimated production and the recommendations
for the allocations for the ensuing months covered by the study. As usual,
he did not take the paper in his hands. A month or so later another study
submitted recommended certain changes in the allocations. I started to orient
him by explaining what the previous allocations had been. He stopped me at
once, stating that he remembered the figures and telling me to give him only
the new figures. 

<P>
Some idea of the magnitude of the task that he performed may be derived from
a study of the Report of the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of War, 1919,
and from General <A NAME="March.177" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>'s book, "The Nation at War." I shall not undertake
to comment further upon this, but shall limit myself to a few comments upon
the personality of General March as I knew him during the period of about
3 1/2 years that I served as Secretary (or assistant Secretary) of the General
Staff.

<P>
He was ruthless in replacing Bureau Chiefs and others whenever he deemed
such action necessary. His attitude may be illustrated by an incident that
occurred shortly after the arrival of General <A NAME="March.186" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> and before I came into
the office. The officer in temporary charge of the office took in a basketful
of papers to make his first presentation to General March. The first paper
he presented pertained to the relief of a general officer from his command
as a result of the recommendation of the Inspector General. General March
interrupted the officer and asked him why he had brought that particular
paper to him. The officer replied that he thought General March would want
to see it as he understood that the officer concerned was a personal friend
of General <A NAME="March.194" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>. General March interrupted him again and said, "Don't ever
bring in to me another paper only because you consider that it concerns someone
who is a personal friend of mine. I want it distinctly understood by you
and by everyone else in the office that as Chief of Staff I have no friends."
The presenting officer then said, "I have a number of important papers here.
I have not had the time to familiarize myself with them, but I brought them
in because I assumed that you would want to study them yourself." General
<A NAME="March.201" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> again interrupted him, with, I have no doubt, a look that was well
remembered by the officer concerned, by saying "Take them out and get familiar
with them before you bring them in again."

<P>
He made practically no appointments with members of Congress in general,
but if they asked to see him they were generally courteously referred to
General <A NAME="Frank.208" HREF="index.html#Frank">Frank</A> <A NAME="McIntyre.208" HREF="index.html#McIntyre">McIntyre</A> (and later to General Mw. M (sic) <A NAME="Wright.208" HREF="index.html#Wright">Wright</A>), the Deputy
Chief of Staff, whose knowledge and personality particularly fitted him to
assuage the ruffled feelings of the caller and generally leave him well satisfied.
However, his relations with Sen. <A NAME="James.211" HREF="index.html#James">James</A> W. <A NAME="Wadsworth.211" HREF="index.html#Wadsworth">Wadsworth</A>, Chairman of the Senate
Military Affairs Committee, and with several other members of Congress in
whose ability and leadership he had confidence, were quite close.

<P>
His unwillingness to take the time to see any Congressman who had a request
for some special request for one of his friends or constituents resulted
in engendering, on the part of some of them, feelings of resentment. This,
I believe, was the basis of the "cabal" that opposed his being given, in
1919, the permanent rank of General.

<P>
In addition to his ability to make quick decisions, he possessed an uncanny
ability to read between the lines. I recall one incident that will illustrate
this perhaps. In June, 1918, when enemy submarines appeared off the <A NAME="Atlantic.225" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A>
coast, the <A NAME="British.226" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> made a strong recommendation that our main port of embarkation
be changed from <A NAME="New York.227" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> to <A NAME="Halifax.227" HREF="index.html#Halifax">Halifax</A>. This recommendation also stated, in
effect, that unless the <A NAME="United States.228" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> agreed to this the British Navy would
be forced to give serious consideration to discontinuing escorting our troops
to <A NAME="France.230" HREF="index.html#France">France</A>. General <A NAME="March.230" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, after considering the paper, with its virtual ultimatum,
for about fifteen minutes, dictated a reply which stated concisely the reasons
why the War Department considered it essential that New York be continued
as the main port of embarkation. The last paragraph of his reply stated that,
in effect, "If the <A NAME="British.234" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> Navy is unable, or unwilling, to continue to convoy
<A NAME="United States.235" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> troops to France, the War Department will continue to rely,
for this purpose, upon the American Navy, which has never failed it yet."
This was the last that was ever heard of the matter. I took occasion, a few
days later, to comment upon the rather unusual nature of the British paper.
He replied that there were other reasons back of it than the one advanced
-- the matter of danger to the British fleet, that it would be very desirable
from their point of view if the United States would build a modern port of
embarkation at <A NAME="Halifax.242" HREF="index.html#Halifax">Halifax</A>, which would, after the war, be available, at no cost,
to <A NAME="Canadian.243" HREF="index.html#Canadian">Canadian</A> and <A NAME="British.243" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> shipping, and which would, furthermore, enable a
bumper crop of Canadian wheat, then rotting on the ground, to be sold and
shipped overseas instead of <A NAME="United States.245" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A> wheat.

<P>
I recall several other incidents that made an impression on me at the time.

<P>
Prior to the arrival of General <A NAME="March.251" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, on not infrequent occasions, the <A NAME="President.251" HREF="index.html#President">President</A>
had, presumably as a matter of routine, sent notes to the Secretary of War
suggesting, in effect, that, if it was not inconsistent with the policy of
the War Department, the President would be glad if such and such an individual
were given a commission in a certain grade and were assigned to such and
such Arm or Service. Shortly after General March arrived such a communication
was received by the Secretary of War and was routinely referred to the office
of the Chief of Staff for action. This was the first communication of this
type that General <A NAME="March.259" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> had received. He gave it his concentrated attention
for a short while, then got up and took it, through the connecting door,
to Mr. <A NAME="Baker.261" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A>'s private office. He stayed in with Mr. Baker for some time
and then came out -- without the paper. Shortly afterwards Mr. Baker put
on his hat and walked over to see Mr. <A NAME="Wilson.263" HREF="index.html#Wilson">Wilson</A>. When he came back it was without
the letter, and it was the last letter of its kind that was sent by Mr. Wilson
during the war.

<P>
General <A NAME="March.268" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> took no exercise except a little tennis in the early morning,
and he had practically no recreation other than the very rare attendance
at a Major League baseball game. During the summer of 1918, when the shipment
of troops overseas was at its height, a delegation of men well known in the
baseball world came to see him, knowing him to be a fellow baseball enthusiast,
and requested him to hold in this country a certain baseball player who was
very popular and who was due for shipment at an early date to <A NAME="France.274" HREF="index.html#France">France</A>, on
the ground that his retention here would greatly help civilian morale. General
<A NAME="March.276" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> listened until they had made the purpose of their visit clear; then
he promptly terminated the interview by saying, "Gentlemen, my job is to
get men to France, not to keep them in this country."

<P>
In his relations with General <A NAME="Pershing.281" HREF="index.html#Pershing">Pershing</A> he was, I believe, always conscious
of the fact that, under the law, (Act of May 12, 1917), he, as Chief of Staff
took rank and precedence over all other officers of the Army, including the
Commanding General of the A. E. F., and that he was (G. O. #80, August 12,
1918), by virtue of his position, charged with the responsibility for the
execution of the Army program, and that he had delegated to him authority
commensurate with that responsibility. He insisted that any communication
from General <A NAME="Pershing.288" HREF="index.html#Pershing">Pershing</A> (some of which had been addressed to the Secretary
of War) to the War Department should be sent to him. He did not hesitate
to disapprove any recommendation from General Pershing, or from his headquarters,
that he considered to be impractical or undesirable. He considered that the
execution of the Army program in this country was the responsibility of the
Chief of Staff, not of the Commanding General A. E. F, and he did not tolerate
any action that was contrary to this view. He considered that he was, by
virtue of his position, the principal advisor of the Secretary of War on
all military matters, and he acted accordingly.

<P>
He scrupulously abstained from interference with General <A NAME="Pershing.299" HREF="index.html#Pershing">Pershing</A> in the
performance of his duties as Commanding General of the A. E. F. I believe
that it can be said truthfully that he "gave General Pershing the greatest
support and American General has ever received from a military superior in
our history." (The Nation at War, page 290.)

<P>
In my opinion it would be an understatement to say that General <A NAME="March.306" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was
not a great admirer of General <A NAME="Crowder.307" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A>; this for several reasons. The National
Defense Act included a provision, (believed to have been inserted at the
behest of General <A NAME="Ainsworth.309" HREF="index.html#Ainsworth">Ainsworth</A>, the late Adjutant General, who had been forced
to retire as a result of the bitter contest between him and General <A NAME="Wood.310" HREF="index.html#Wood">Wood</A>,
the then Chief of Staff, as to which should run the Army) which prescribed
that the General Staff "should be exclusively employed on duties not of an
administrative nature." Mr. <A NAME="Baker.313" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A> had become Secretary of War shortly after
the passage of the Act on <A NAME="March.314" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> 9, 1918. Shortly after the approval of the
Act on June 3rd, 1916, Judge Advocate General <A NAME="Crowder.315" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A> (so far as I know without
having been called upon to do so) rendered an opinion construing this legislation
as eliminating the supervisory functions of the General Staff, thus prohibiting
it from exercising any control over the Bureaus of the War Department. Secretary
Baker, with remarkable courage and insight, disapproved this opinion and
directed that the Chief of Staff should "coordinate and supervise the various
bureaus, offices and departments of the War Department." Without this action
by Mr. <A NAME="Baker.322" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A> it would have been impossible for any Chief of Staff to have
exercised effective control over the War Department during the War.

<P>
By the time General <A NAME="March.326" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> had become Chief of Staff the <A NAME="Draft.326" HREF="index.html#Draft">Draft</A> Act had been
in operation nearly a year, and it had been generally recognized as having
been a great success. General <A NAME="Crowder.328" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A>, as Provost Marshal General, was generally
given credit both for the conception of the Draft and for the preparation
of the detailed instructions and regulations which had made its operation
so successful, credit which he apparently accepted as his just due. General
March states in his book that he was informed by Secretary <A NAME="Baker.332" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A> that General
Crowder had actually been opposed to the introduction of such a <A NAME="Bill.333" HREF="index.html#Bill">Bill</A> in Congress
because he did not believe that either the Congress or the people would accept
it. It is certain that Mr. Baker was fully entitled to credit for the basic
conception of the <A NAME="Draft.336" HREF="index.html#Draft">Draft</A> -- namely that it should be conducted by local Boards
of civilians -- which was primarily responsible for its success, and, to
a very great degree he was responsible for securing the passage of the Act
by Congress. Colonel <A NAME="Hugh.339" HREF="index.html#Hugh">Hugh</A> S. <A NAME="Johnson.339" HREF="index.html#Johnson">Johnson</A>, of the office of the Provost Marshal
General, was personally responsible for the preparation of the Draft Regulations
and for the procedures that were followed in the operation of the Draft.

<P>
The extensive and favorable publicity received by General <A NAME="Crowder.344" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A> served
to enhance his popularity with the 4600 <A NAME="Draft.345" HREF="index.html#Draft">Draft</A> Boards throughout the country,
and, in my opinion, General <A NAME="March.346" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was probably inclined to believe that General
Crowder was in no way unaware of the possible political advantages to be
derived from the support of such a nation wide organization as those Draft
Boards, particularly as General Crowder sought to continue them in existence
to conduct the demobilization under the Provost Marshal General.

<P>
General <A NAME="Crowder.353" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A>, as Provost Marshal General, functioned directly under the
Secretary of War and was independent of the Chief of Staff.

<P>
All of these considerations were, I believe, involved in determining General
<A NAME="March.358" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>'s personal feelings toward General Crowder.

<P>
I recall an incident in the summer of 1918 that may be of interest in this
connection. General <A NAME="Crowder.362" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A>, as Provost Marshal General, submitted to the
Secretary of War a proposal that the Provost Marshal General give some military
training to draftees before they were turned over to the Army. Upon the reference
of this communication to General <A NAME="March.365" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> he insisted that all military training
should be conducted by the military authorities, and that such training was
not within the province of the Provost Marshal General. As I recall it, General
Crowder then, in a somewhat sharply worded indorsement or memorandum took
exception to these views and insisted that such training could and should
be given by the Provost Marshal General. General March then, in a sharper
worded communication, reiterated his strong objection to the conduct of any
military training by the Provost Marshal General. It seemed to me that the
papers submitted to the Secretary of War by each the Provost Marshal General
and the Chief of Staff contained what was, in effect, almost an ultimatum
that his point of view should be supported by the Secretary of War. I recall
that, when all the papers were returned to the office of the Secretary of
War, I felt sorry that Mr. <A NAME="Baker.377" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A>, in addition to his other problems, should
be confronted with such situation, and I wondered how he could possibly handle
it.

<P>
Within a day or two Mr. Baker's action was received. It consisted of an identical
Memorandum to each the Provost Marshal General and the Chief of Staff, typed
on less than half a sheet of letter size paper, in which he analyzed the
question at issue, outlined succinctly the functions of each the Provost
Marshal General and the Chief of Staff, announced his decision (which, as
I recall it, was that all military training should be conducted under the
Chief of Staff), and made it clear that each General <A NAME="Crowder.388" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A> and General
<A NAME="March.389" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was invaluable in his own sphere of activity and that it was essential
that they work together as a team. In short, the Memorandum, which I hope
is still available in the files, exemplified to perhaps a greater degree
than any other that I recall, the remarkable analytical ability, impartiality,
judicial qualities, power of decision and clarity of expression of Mr. <A NAME="Baker.393" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A>.
It left nothing more to be said, and it served to compose the existing differences
between General March and General <A NAME="Crowder.395" HREF="index.html#Crowder">Crowder</A>.

<P>
In his dealings with officers and civilians, General <A NAME="March.398" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> had no time for
the ordinary amenities of conversation. He came straight to the point, made
a decision where one was required, and then terminated the conversation.

<P>
I do not know of anyone that he habitually called by his first name (other
than the members of his family), with one exception. (He probably did so
also in the case of General <A NAME="George.405" HREF="index.html#George">George</A> W. <A NAME="Burr.405" HREF="index.html#Burr">Burr</A>, Director of Purchase, Storage,
and Traffic, and General <A NAME="Peter.406" HREF="index.html#Peter">Peter</A> C. <A NAME="Harris.406" HREF="index.html#Harris">Harris</A>, The Adjutant General, both of whom
were classmates of General <A NAME="March.407" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>). That exception was General <A NAME="Henry.407" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Jervey.407" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A>,
Director of Operations. I should like to comment briefly on General Jervey.

<P>
General March and General Jervey were classmates at <A NAME="West Point.411" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, General Jervey
having graduated No. 1 and General March having graduated No. 10 in the class
of 1888, which consisted of 44 members. General Jervey was an Engineer and
General <A NAME="March.414" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> was a Field Artilleryman. In 1917 Colonel <A NAME="Jervey.414" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A> was promoted
to Brigadier General in the National Army and was assigned to the command
of a Brigade in a Division scheduled for early shipment to <A NAME="France.416" HREF="index.html#France">France</A>. Upon arrival
of the Division at the Port of Embarkation, under the policy then in effect,
all general officers were given a thorough physical examination. General
Jervey was found to be not physically qualified for overseas service, and
his Brigade sailed without him. Pending new orders he came to <A NAME="Washington.420" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>,
and General <A NAME="March.421" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> having just arrived there he went in to see him. General
March was very glad to see him and, after exchanging greetings, he asked
General <A NAME="Jervey.423" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A> what he was doing in Washington. General Jervey replied that
he had been physically disqualified for foreign service and that he had come
to Washington to request that he be returned to his permanent grade of Colonel
and be assigned to appropriate Engineer duties. General March's reply was
something to this effect: "Well, <A NAME="Henry.427" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A>, this is the first time that I ever
had an officer asked to be reduced in grade. I know you well enough to know
that somewhere in this war there is a job that you can fill with credit in
your present grade of Brigadier General, and I propose to see that you are
made full use of. I don't know now just what that job is, but I want to have
you at hand. There is a small Operations Committee in a room down the hall.
I wish you would, for the present, sit in with that Committee and give them
any help you can, and you can forget about being returned to your permanent
grade."

<P>
In a short time General <A NAME="Jervey.438" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A> had acquired such a thorough grasp of the
problems confronting this Committee that General <A NAME="March.439" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> began to rely more
and more on his recommendations. Upon the reorganization of the General Staff
and the creation of the Operations Division General Jervey was promoted to
temporary Major General and made Director of Operations, which position he
held until September, 1921.

<P>
I know of no officer in the Army, other than General <A NAME="March.446" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, who personally
carried a greater load of responsibility in our war effort than General <A NAME="Jervey.447" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A>.
The multitude and importance of duties performed by the Operations Division
is indicated in the Report of the Chief of Staff for 1919. General March
conferred frequently with General Jervey, in whose judgement and ability
he had the greatest confidence, and to whom, from time to time as difficult
situations arose, he assigned important responsibilities in addition to those
normally pertaining to the Operations Division, as, for instance, the supervision
of the Personnel Branch and of the Motor Transport Corps.

<P>
In my daily contacts with General <A NAME="Jervey.457" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A> over a period of about three years
I was constantly amazed at the uniform high quality of the work turned out
by the Operations Division. There was not one officer in the Division who
had ever had any General Staff experience and a great many of them were Reserve
officers of relatively little experience. This high quality was due primarily
to the remarkable personality, character and ability of General Jervey, to
his unremitting industry, to his patience and calmness under stress, and
to his rare faculty of being able to instill into his subordinates his own
high standards of thoroughness and of loyalty. I am sure that there was no
officer who served under him who did not feel for him a high admiration and
a deep affection. I never knew him to attribute to anyone else any error
(of which there were very few) that might have occurred in any paper that
came from the Operations Division.

<P>
To me he exemplified, more than any man I have known, the qualities that
endeared General <A NAME="Robert.473" HREF="index.html#Robert">Robert</A> E. <A NAME="Lee.473" HREF="index.html#Lee">Lee</A> to his subordinates. I regret exceedingly
that he has never received due recognition for his great contribution to
the planning and execution of the War program.

<P>
General <A NAME="March.478" HREF="index.html#March">March</A> rarely laughed; he did grin, with his lips only, on occasion.
<A NAME="Frederick.479" HREF="index.html#Frederick">Frederick</A> <A NAME="Palmer.479" HREF="index.html#Palmer">Palmer</A>, in his "<A NAME="Newton.479" HREF="index.html#Newton">Newton</A> D. <A NAME="Baker.479" HREF="index.html#Baker">Baker</A>", well expressed the significance
of this grin when he wrote, "According to various interpretations of the
March grin, it might be taken as appreciation of a joke; or as an intimation
that he saw through a suggestion and it did not wash; or the prospect pleased
him and so go ahead; or he was administering a dose of medicine."

<P>
During my long association with him our relations were close. My position
as Secretary of the General Staff required that I know his views exactly
in order that I might be able to pass advisedly on the great number of papers
that were sent out without reference to him, and he expressed these views
freely and frankly as occasion arose. He gave me whole hearted support on
the occasions where it was necessary. He never asked me a question as to
the personnel or organization of my office. He never expressed to me personally
either criticism or approbation of my work, although he was most considerate
in the ratings he gave me on my Efficiency Reports.

<P>
I believe I was as close to him as any one on the General Staff except perhaps
General <A NAME="Jervey.498" HREF="index.html#Jervey">Jervey</A>, but the relationship between us was on a strictly official
-- and never on a personal -- basis. He inspired, in a high degree, confidence,
admiration, respect and loyalty. He did not inspire affection.

<P>
I conclude these notes with a quotation from an author whose identity, I
regret, is not now known to me, in which I concur entirely.

<P>
"General <A NAME="March.507" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>, as Chief of Staff, demonstrated ability as an organizer and
executive of the highest order. It is doubtful if any other American soldier
has ever been called upon to assume equal responsibilities. The results accomplished
were made possible only by his extraordinary capacity for work, his broad
vision, his ability to distinguish at once between the essential and the
unessential and his capacity of making quick and accurate decisions. In a
surprisingly short time he brought order out of confusion and chaos. While
naturally quiet and reserved, he was quick, concise, forceful, decisive and
efficient. He radiated concentrated energy and he possessed the faculty of
imparting his power of accomplishment to his associates. He was a natural
leader, more by virtue, however, of his keen and analytical mind, his force
and determination, and his integrity of purpose and principle, than by his
personal magnetism."

<P>
I believe that history will regard him as an organizer and executive without
a superior in American history. In my opinion he was probably more responsible
than any other one man in the <A NAME="United States.524" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>, if not in the world, that this
country sent to <A NAME="France.525" HREF="index.html#France">France</A> the second million men during the four months of May,
June, July and August, 1918, thereby making it possible for the war to be
brought to a victorious conclusion in 1918 instead of late in 1919.
