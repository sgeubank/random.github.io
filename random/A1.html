A1. A WESTERN (IT COULD BE AN EASTERN) STORY 

</H3>
<HR align=left>
When Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.19" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> graduated from the University of <A NAME="Mississippi.19" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> (about 1878),
as I have stated previously, he was not given  diploma on account of  his
activities as the ringleader of the first fraternity ever organized at the
University. At that time the <A NAME="Indian.22" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A> Territory was a part of the Wild West,
now-a-days portrayed so repetitiously, if not unrealistically, in our TV
programs. Transportation between the scattered towns was largely by stage
coach, and in the larger towns, connected by railroad, there were generally
one or two general stores which supplied practically all the needs of a considerable
area, this being before the days of <A NAME="Montgomery.27" HREF="index.html#Montgomery">Montgomery</A> Ward and <A NAME="Sears.27" HREF="index.html#Sears">Sears</A> <A NAME="Roebuck.27" HREF="index.html#Roebuck">Roebuck</A>.

<P>
The Territory appealed to the adventurous spirit of the young <A NAME="Skipwith.30" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>, and
as his first venture in business he worked for several years as a traveling
salesman (otherwise known as a drummer) in the Territory for a large clothing
manufacturer in <A NAME="New York.33" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>.

<P>
He once told me of an incident that occurred at the time of his periodic
visit to one of the towns, the name of which, being immaterial, I have forgotten.

<P>
In this rather large town there were two or three general stores, the largest
one of which was owned by a wealthy old Jew. <A NAME="Skipwith.41" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> had always done business
with the other stores. He always made it a practice, however, to call on
the Jew owner, with whom he was quite friendly.

<P>
On the occasion of the trip under consideration, Skipwith, having completed
his business to his entire satisfaction, was sitting, in the evening, at
a table in the lobby of the hotel, making out his routine sales reports.
Opening off the lobby was a room devoted to various types of gambling.

<P>
While he was at work he could not help but notice a young Jew seated near
him who seemed highly nervous and distressed. He saw him several times take
out of his pocket, read and reread a letter obviously in a woman's handwriting.
From time to time he glanced in the gambling room, and it was obvious that
he was considering going in the room to gamble, for some reason connected
with the letter.

<P>
At this point <A NAME="Skipwith.60" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> got up and went over to the young man. He introduced
himself and said: "I have been watching you for the last hour, and I am quite
sure that you are in trouble of some kind, and that you are apparently desperate
enough about it to go in there and gamble in the hope of winning enough to
get you out of your trouble.

<P>
I have been here a number of times and I know that the gambling in there
is  crooked. You may be allowed to win a little at the beginning, but in
the end you will loses everything you have.

<P>
I do not know, of course, what your trouble is, but please let me advise
you that I am sure that gambling in there will not help."

<P>
The young man looked at him, uncertain what to do or say. Then his eyes filled
with tears, and he began to tell <A NAME="Skipwith.77" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> his story.

<P>
His father had been a wealthy man and he had always lived in luxury. About
the time he graduated from college his father died, and it soon developed
that he had recently lost his fortune and that the son would have to make
his own living. He had no business experience and, after seeking a position
for several months without success as a last resort he went to one of his
father's old friends, who was the head of a large clothing manufacturing
business, and asked him for any kind of a job that he could get. The friend
stated that the only job he could offer him was to replace, on a commission
basis, the firm's traveling salesman, who had recently died, in the <A NAME="Indian.88" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A>
Territory. The young man gratefully accepted the position, and was now on
his first trip. He had already been on the road for several weeks, visiting
towns where his firm had always done a good business, but in each case he
had not been able to make a good sale. A recent letter from his company had
stated that his showing to date had been very disappointing, and that unless
he was able to make as good a sale in the next town (the one he was then
in) he was to visit as his predecessor had made the previous year he would
receive no more expense money and his employment would be terminated.

<P>
He further told <A NAME="Skipwith.99" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> that, on the strength of getting his present job,
and being fully confident of his success in it, he had married the girl he
had been in love with for several years, and had had just time enough to
get her settled in a small apartment before leaving on his first trip; that
she had written him several letters telling him that she needed money to
pay the household bills. He showed him the latest letter he had received
and which he had been reading. In it the young bride told him that the grocer
and the butcher had just told her that they could not give her any more credit,
that she had explained to him the need for sufficient money to meet these
essential needs, but that he had not sent her any, and that she could only
conclude that he didn't love her any more, etc., etc.

<P>
He admitted that he had just about made up his mind to risk gambling all
the money he had, in the hope of making a big enough winning to enable him
to send his wife the money she needed, and that, if he lost instead of winning,
he would probably end it all in despair.

<P>
<A NAME="Skipwith.118" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> told him that he would accompany him into the gambling hall, and
made him promise that he would quit whenever Skipwith told him to do so.
They went to the roulette wheel, and Skipwith stood by while the other played
the wheel. They were both well dressed and prosperous looking and the dealer
sized them up as good prospects. He let the boy win about $50, at which point
Skipwith signalled him to quit. They then returned to the lobby and Skipwith
said to him: "I think your luck has changed now and that everything is going
to work out all right. I know your line of goods, and they are as good as
anybody's. You go up to your room, get a table from the clerk and put all
of your samples on it as carefully as you can. We will talk things over again
tomorrow."

<P>
Next morning <A NAME="Skipwith.131" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> went to see the old Jew who owned the big store, who
at once informed him that he didn't want to buy anything, as business had
been so poor, etc., etc. Skipwith said: "I didn't come in with the idea of
selling you anything. I have already sold a bill of goods to so and so, my
regular customers. I came here to tell you about a young Jew who is at the
hotel." He told him all about the young man's story, and concluded by saying:
"I know that his line of goods is as good as anybody's, and I know that your
stock is low in many lines. You have it in your power to purchase what you
need at as low a price as you can possibly get it, and at the same time to
do a kindness to a fine young man of your race that may save his career.
i have told him to put all his samples out on display, and that I thought
that everything was going to be all right with him. I have nothing more to
say; the matter is in your hands."

<P>
The old man reiterated his remarks about how poor business had been, but
said that he might possibly drop in next day and look over the line of goods.

<P>
<A NAME="Skipwith.150" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> departed the next morning without seeing the young Jew, and the
incident in time passed from his mind. Some six months later he boarded a
train and was surprised when a well dressed and prosperous looking young
man rushed up to him, threw his arm around him and said: "Mr. Skipwith, don't
you remember me? I am the young drummer you were so kind to in so and so
about six months ago. I have been hoping ever since to see you again and
tell you about the strangest thing that happened next day. You know old man
<A NAME="Jacobs.157" HREF="index.html#Jacobs">Jacobs</A>, who owns the <A NAME="Boston.157" HREF="index.html#Boston">Boston</A> store there. We have sold him for years, but
when I called upon him the day you saw me he told me that he wouldn't be
able to buy anything from me. Next day, however, he came in to see me, talked
with me for a while, and finally wound up by giving me the biggest order
that we had ever sold him. And do you know that from that time on I have
had no trouble at all. My sales are very satisfactory to the firm; my wife
is very happy indeed, and you were right in telling me that my luck was bound
to change." Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.164" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> added that for many years after the incident he
regularly received a box of cigars on Christmas from his drummer friend.

<P>
I have remembered this story, and I have repeated it to you, because I believe
the old Jew was an interesting character.
