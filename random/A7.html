A7. A CAPTURED SUBMARINE.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Another submarine story that I recall from World War I I read, at the time,
in <A NAME="L'Illustration.22" HREF="index.html#L'Illustration">L'Illustration</A>. Let's call it

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
A CAPTURED SUBMARINE.

<HR>
A <A NAME="British.28" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> Destroyer, while patrolling in the North Sea, observed what appeared
to be a <A NAME="German.29" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarine aground, at low tide, in shoal water.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Fearing that it might be another mystery ship disguised as a disabled submarine,
it opened fire on it at long range, when a white flag was promptly run up
on the submarine.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
A Boarding Party was then sent on board the submarine and it found out that
it was the first one to be put in service of a new type of submarine in which
the mines were kept in vertical tubes, open to the water, extending from
the deck through the hull and so designed that any desired number of the
mines could be planted by being released by suitable tripping mechanisms.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The <A NAME="Admiralty.44" HREF="index.html#Admiralty">Admiralty</A> had known of the development of this type of submarine and
was exceedingly anxious to secure information as to the details of its design.
The Boarding Party was elated at their discovery and communicated it to the
Commander of the destroyer, who then came aboard the submarine to examine
it.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He discovered that all the launching tubes were empty, which indicated that
all the mines had been planted.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
He decided that it might be practicable to float the submarine at high tide,
and if so that he might be able to take it in to one of the <A NAME="British.56" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> ports,
where it could be given the most careful attention.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
When he informed the Commander of the submarine what he planned to do, he
was surprised to note that the <A NAME="German.61" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> Commander seemed to be pleased. It
dawned upon him that the fact that the launching tubes were all empty might
mean that the German commander, realizing that the capture of his submarine
was imminent, and that the <A NAME="British.64" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> commander would undoubtedly desire to
take it to a British port and would, for this purpose, in all likelihood
place a British crew aboard, had conceived the brilliant idea of dumping
all his mines under the bow of the submarine so that when the submarine moved
it and the British crew aboard would certainly be destroyed.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The <A NAME="British.71" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> commander, after some consideration, said to the <A NAME="German.71" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> commander:
"I am going to withdraw all my men from the ship, and it will be manned by
your crew. I shall direct you when to get under way and I shall escort you
to your destination." The German protested so volubly that such procedure
was irregular and contrary to international law that the Britisher was confident
that his suspicions were confirmed, and he and his men returned to the Destroyer,
which stood by waiting for high tide.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In a couple of hours they observed through the glasses that divers from the
submarine were going over board and removing the full complement of mines
from under the bow of the vessel -- a procedure that was, by no means, devoid
of danger.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
At high tide the <A NAME="British.86" HREF="index.html#British">British</A> commander directed the <A NAME="German.86" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> submarine to get under
way, which it did without difficulty, and the submarine intact was delivered
to the British port, where every detail of its construction was most carefully
examined and studied.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I think this story too affords some grounds for believing that the British
do have a sense of humor -- of a kind.
