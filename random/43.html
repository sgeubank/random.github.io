43. PROBLEMS OF RETIREMENT.

</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>


<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Having retired, I was faced with a difficult problem.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I realized, from past observation, that it was necessary that I should find
something that would keep me interested and occupied, if I was not to begin
to deteriorate mentally and physically. I had no hobbies; I didn't play cards;
I didn't care for hunting deer (with a shotgun) or for fishing; I hadn't
played golf since the morning of <A NAME="Pearl Harbor.29" HREF="index.html#Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</A>. After much thought I decided
to remodel the old slave quarters on the place and to fit it up as a wood
working shop, with a carefully selected assortment of power tools. I had
always liked to work with my hands, but, in my 46 years service, I had never
had the time and the opportunity to do so, since it had been so easy to call
the QM or the Engineer for a plumber, carpenter or electrician.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As a matter of fact I didn't know the difference between a bench saw and
a band saw or a jig saw.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
After studying numerous catalogs and conferring with many different people
I installed a fairly complete wood working shop and purchased a number of
handbooks on the various tools, which I studied assiduously.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The shop has been a boon to me, and I know of no more pleasant or more effective
means of providing both physical and mental exercise and relaxation for a
retired person. It has enabled me to build a good deal of furniture and to
take over practically all maintenance work connected with the place.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Each piece of furniture that I have built has been designed to meet a particular
need, and has been an original design. In each case the design has taken
considerable time. Having decided upon the general type of piece desired,
I have studied various catalogs, reviewed a number of Homecraft magazines
which I have accumulated, and examined much furniture in stores, homes, motels
and elsewhere. Then in the actual design the detailed dimensions of each
joint and of each piece of lumber have had to be worked out. Next it has
been necessary to plan just how, with the equipment available (or required
to be procured) the actual shop work could be done. Finally it has been necessary
to decide just what kind of finish should be given the piece when completed.
(In the <A NAME="Blonde.62" HREF="index.html#Blonde">Blonde</A> finish furniture in the Living Room, and in that made for
<A NAME="Shirley.63" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A>, some 40 different mixtures were made before getting one that was
satisfactory.) Then the finish itself has to be applied.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
These various activities have afforded ample mental and physical exercise
to maintain a keen interest in life, for which I am profoundly grateful.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon my return to <A NAME="Summerville.71" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A> to live the question at once arose as to where
we should live.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The heating system in the house consisted of a wood burning one pipe furnace,
which was totally inadequate for heating the house, the tin roof was beginning
to leak, and the general appearance of the house was run down. However, the
house was constructed entirely of long leaf pine lumber (the sills being
12 or 14 inches on a side, the joists being 3 by 12 inches, and the studding
being 4" by 4", all of which was in splendid condition.)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
It was a question whether to tear the house down and, using as much as possible
of the lumber, to build a modern bungalo type house, or whether to rehabilitate
the house itself. The large rooms, the fireplaces, the arrangement of the
rooms (each room having three exposures -- to catch any breeze that might
be coming) and the feeling that there had been much pleasant living in the
house by many generations of home loving people, all led us to feel that
this house, if given careful and considerate attention, would be a more suitable
and more pleasant house for us and for our children and grandchildren than
a new bungalo type house could ever be, and we accordingly decided to rehabilitate
the house and make it our home.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
So Wm. <A NAME="Seele.95" HREF="index.html#Seele">Seele</A> and three or four of his assistants were employed at work for
some five or six months. They removed the tin roof (and the two layers of
hand made cypress shingles underlying it) and installed asbestos shingles,
rebuilt the barn into a double car garage, rebuilt the old slave's quarters
into a shop, rebuilt the front fence, replastered much of the walls of the
sitting room and of the bed room above it, laid a concrete apron at the entrance
road to the place, opened up another entrance at the east end of the property,
and did various other similar jobs.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
While I was on duty in <A NAME="Boston.105" HREF="index.html#Boston">Boston</A> I had met a very competent Heating Engineer
and I had many talks with him about the best type of heating system to install
in an old house like ours. I became interested in the technical details of
the matter, and I procured several books on the subject, which I studied
with much interest. As a result I decided to design, and then to install,
a hot water, 3 zone, reverse return system, and this work was begun soon
after I retired. The shortage of all kinds of heating equipment and parts
just after the war was even more marked than during the war, and, as the
result of the ensuing delays, the installation was not completed until January,
1948. This installation has been most satisfactory in all respects.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
In the summer of 1949 I installed an attic fan. In 1956 an Air Conditioner
was installed in the Living Room. As the result of these three installations
we are really more comfortable, all the year round, at home than at any other
place.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The maintenance of the place has kept me quite fully occupied, since, with
the shop available, I have been able to take this over almost entirely. This
has included such items as the installing of new piping for the plumbing,
the installation of new electric wiring throughout the house and in the garage
and in the shop, the painting of the exterior of the house (once only however)
and of the entire interior of the house, the construction of 2nd floor rooms
in the cabin (with an attic fan) and of the glass enclosure for the cabin
porch.

At the end of the two years that <A NAME="Perry.133" HREF="index.html#Perry">Perry</A> was on duty as a student officer at
Cal Tech he graduated with a Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering.
This was a most difficult accomplishment. His difficulties were in no way
minimized (and neither were <A NAME="Shirley.136" HREF="index.html#Shirley">Shirley</A>'s) by the fact that, during this period,
both <A NAME="Huston.137" HREF="index.html#Huston">Huston</A> and <A NAME="Dan.137" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A> were born.

time had just reported for duty as a student officer at Cal Tech.

<A NAME="Hawaii.157" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>, for duty as Assistant Brigade Commander.
