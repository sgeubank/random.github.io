33. IN COMMAND OF FORT HANCOCK, NEW JERSEY.

</H3>
<HR align=left>


<P>
So, on about November 1, 1937, we drove up to Fort <A NAME="Hancock.22" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A>. The post of Fort
Hancock was in a terribly run down condition. Due to lack of funds, the quarters,
barracks and other buildings were in a dilapidated state, the armament had
been neglected, the morale of the officers and their families and of the
enlisted men was low, and the post had a heavy schedule of visiting troops
for training each summer. Shortly after I arrived the Officer's Club caught
fire and was greatly damaged.

<P>
The only way any money could be secured was through the WPA, either in New
Jersey or in <A NAME="New York.32" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> (the subpost of Fort <A NAME="Tilden.32" HREF="index.html#Tilden">Tilden</A> was in New York), so, by
visiting the officials in charge and by agreeing to keep several hundred
men employed, doing mostly common labor (at Fort Tilden they moved sand by
hand, from one side of the road to the other and then back again), we were
able to get sufficient funds to repair the buildings, to rebuild the club,
to improve the hospital, and, in general, to restore the morale of the post.

<P>
During the period of seven months that we were stationed at Fort <A NAME="Hancock.40" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A>
we gained considerable experience in the problems of a Commanding Officer
and of a Commanding Officer's wife.

<P>
The quarters at Fort Hancock had been designed by <A NAME="Stanford.45" HREF="index.html#Stanford">Stanford</A> <A NAME="White.45" HREF="index.html#White">White</A>, the famous
architect, (who was killed by <A NAME="Harry.46" HREF="index.html#Harry">Harry</A> <A NAME="Thaw.46" HREF="index.html#Thaw">Thaw</A>, resulting in one of the most famous
trials in our history), and we found our sojourn at Fort <A NAME="Hancock.47" HREF="index.html#Hancock">Hancock</A> to be a
very interesting and instructive one.
