12. At Fort <A NAME="Riley.15" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>
</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>
Upon my arrival at Fort
Riley I was met by Lieut. <A NAME="Glassford.19" HREF="index.html#Glassford">Glassford</A> and Lieut. <A NAME="Danford.19" HREF="index.html#Danford">Danford</A>, two of my classmates,
who occupied a set of quarters which they invited me to share with them.
They were greatly amused at my <A NAME="Rip.21" HREF="index.html#Rip">Rip</A> Van Winkle appearance, with a month's
growth of variegated and untamed whiskers, <A NAME="Buffalo.22" HREF="index.html#Buffalo">Buffalo</A> skin cap and gauntlets
and an issue coat with sleeves two inches too short and with issue shoes
worn thin and scorched by overexposure to the <A NAME="Sibley.24" HREF="index.html#Sibley">Sibley</A> stove while wet. I was
eager to get a hot bath and a shave and to get into a proper uniform, but
they insisted that I should some on just as I was and meet "The <A NAME="Taylor.26" HREF="index.html#Taylor">Taylor</A> boys"
(two daughters of Colonel Taylor, the Post Commander, who lived next door).
We rang the bell at Colonel Taylor's quarters, and when one of the girls
opened the door they shoved me into the hall and closed the door. She looked
at me, burst out laughing and said "I may get over this, but I'll never look
the same again." I assured her that I expected never to look the same again
myself.<P ALIGN=LEFT>My Captain, Captain <A NAME="Ernest.32" HREF="index.html#Ernest">Ernest</A> Hinds, joined the Battery soon after
our arrival and commanded the Battery throughout my stay at Fort <A NAME="Riley.33" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>. He
was perhaps the most brilliant, and certainly the most unassuming officer
that I ever served under. I was his Reconnaissance Officer for more than
two years, and during the period of four or five hours each day that I spent
with him at drill or at target practice I received most valuable training
and instruction in Field Artillery technique -- such as I could not have
gotten anywhere else.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I recall one incident that occurred during this period.
The Regiment (with its six Batteries), with a Wagon Train of Army and Escort
wagons fully loaded with hay and oats, had set out for a week's Field Exercise.
The <A NAME="Kaw.42" HREF="index.html#Kaw">Kaw</A> River ran along one side of the Fort <A NAME="Riley.42" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A> Reservation and there
is a natural contour of "rim rock" parallel to the river and perhaps 200
feet above it. The debris resulting from erosion forms a steep slope from
the rim rock down to the level of the river. The first day of the Exercise
included some exercises conducted on the Reservation, above the rim rock.
Near the end of the day the Regimental Commander sent for me, stated that
he was going to move the regiment, by road, to a camp for the night in 4-mile
Canyon. This camp site was practically in sight of our position at the time,
but to reach it by road required about a ten mile trip. He directed me to
take charge of the Wagon Train (perhaps 15 Army or Escort wagons) and bring
them in to camp. Had I followed the regiment (as he expected me to do) I
would not have gotten into camp until late that night. Captain Hinds had
trained our Battery, the guns and caissons of which were equipped with positive
and powerful brakes, in moving up and down across the rim rock. At our position
there was a vertical drop of about six feet from the edge of the rim rock,
and then began a steep slope (of perhaps 35 degrees), several hundred feet
long down to the level of the road in the bottom of the canyon in which the
camp was to be located. I decided to take the wagon train down over the rim
rock. I dismounted the drivers, had them pile some rocks over the edge of
the rim rock to eliminate the six foot drop, and prepared to send down the
first wagon, which was top heavy with a big load of baled hay. The terrain
was such that a wagon, on getting over the rim rock had to move down a steep
slope, generally parallel to the rim rock, for about 75 yards, and then make
a sharp, right angle turn and go down the long slope to the road below. It
was necessary to make this right angle turn because otherwise it would go
over the edge of a ravine, with a sheer drop of perhaps 50 feet. I instructed
the driver and the assistant driver to keep the foot brake of the wagon applied
hard, and started them off. The wagon gained speed rapidly, the mules began
to gallop, both drivers fell off the seat and were being dragged along the
ground while holding precariously to the wagon tongue, the brakes were off
entirely, and the six mule team was headed, at a run, for the 50 foot drop
into the ravine. There was no earthly power that could have prevented the
mules, with the wagon and the two drivers, from catapulting over the edge
of the ravine. The drivers of the other wagons and I held our breaths and
watched them helplessly. The lashings of the top heavy load of hay loosened
and the hay scattered along the route of the bouncing wagon, the drivers
maintaining their holds onto the wagon tongue. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Just at the moment when
we were expecting to see them all disappear over the edge, the linch pin
of the right front wheel came out, the wheel came off, and the axle dug into
the ground, bringing the wagon to a halt with the noses of the lead mules
about three feet from the edge. We reassembled and reloaded the wagon, and
it was in as good condition as ever (a tribute to the capacity to the old
Army -- or Escort -- wagons to take punishment.) We turned it at a right
angle, turned all four wheels so they could not turn, tied the brakes on,
had a man run along beside each wheel with a chock to throw under the wheel
to prevent it from sliding, and started it down the long slope. In spite
of all our precautions to slow up the wagon its speed increased so that the
mules went down at a run. However it reached the bottom safely and each of
the other wagons in turn followed and also made the descent safely. We arrived
at the camp safely ahead of the regiment. The Regimental Commander was incredulous
when I told him, in as casual a way as possible, that we had come down over
the rim rock, and he and his staff later rode out to satisfy themselves,
I suppose, from the wagon tracks that we had actually done so.<P ALIGN=LEFT>This incident
served to enhance my reputation as an efficient young officer and the Regimental
Commander thereafter generally put me in charge of the train during the frequent
Exercises that we participated in.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I mention this incident for this reason:
Had <A NAME="Providence.98" HREF="index.html#Providence">Providence</A> not intervened, the mules, wagons and drivers would undoubtedly
have been destroyed, and I feel sure that the Investigating Board could not
have found otherwise than that, due to my poor judgement and inefficiency,
the accident had resulted, with the result that my whole future as an an
officer would have been seriously impaired. Actually, as matters worked out,
the incident redounded considerably to my credit. I know of no better example
of how delicate is the balance, on the scales of Fate, between success and
failure, that may exist many times in the Career of any officer (or, for
that matter, of any civilian).<P ALIGN=LEFT>I may add that I never found it necessary
or expedient to recount the details of the descent of the first wagon.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The
School of Application for <A NAME="Cavalry.108" HREF="index.html#Cavalry">Cavalry</A> and Field Artillery was located at Fort
<A NAME="Riley.109" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>. The first year I was there it was conducted as a Post School, and
most of the Lieutenants, including me, attended it. The next year it was
changed to a War Department School and, in order to get credit for attendance,
it was necessary to be detailed by War Department orders to attend the school
again. There was much competition among the Lieutenants for this detail,
and I was very glad that, due doubtless to Captain Hind's recommendation,
I was among those detailed. The course included about four hours a day in
Equitation and in highschooling young horses in the Riding Hall, under Captain
<A NAME="Walter.117" HREF="index.html#Walter">Walter</A> <A NAME="Short.117" HREF="index.html#Short">Short</A> (a former jockey). We also took the course in the new Cooks
and Bakers school. We made all the bread for about 6000 visiting troops during
an Exercise, and we made out the menus, drew the rations, and cooked the
meals for the prisoners in the Post Guardhouse. (Fortunately no one objected
that this was unconstitutional as being a cruel and unusual punishment.)
While taking a high jump on a new horse, he shied at the hurdle and threw
me up on his withers. He then began bucking and at each buck I slipped farther
down his neck towards his ears. I was in a position of very unstable equilibrium.
The gallery (of Post femmes) seemed to think this was very amusing. I did
not share entirely their belief and I decided to end their suspense by throwing
myself off the horse onto the tanbark. I landed on my right hand and injured
the metacarpal bones of that wrist so that I had to keep my forearm in a
plaster cast for about three months. When the cast was removed, apparently
adhesions had formed which made it quite painful to try to hold anything
in my right hand. During this three month's period the class had taken the
Horse Shoeing course, each student being required to shoe 25 horses. In order
to graduate I had to make up this work during the summer, and the necessity
of using my hand, regardless of the pain involved, probably served to restore
the use of the hand to the point that I was not retired for Physical disability
until I was retired for age at 64.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Lieut. J. DeB. W. <A NAME="Gardner.136" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>, <A NAME="Cavalry.136" HREF="index.html#Cavalry">Cavalry</A>,
Class of 1905, was stationed at Fort <A NAME="Riley.137" HREF="index.html#Riley">Riley</A>. We frequently got our mail mixed
up. While I was there he received orders to report to the U.S.M.A. for duty
as an Instructor in History and Law. Several years later I learned that his
name, through a clerical error, had been submitted to the War Department
instead of mine -- an error I never regretted.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In the spring of 1907 my
Battalion was sent on a trip to northern <A NAME="Kansas.142" HREF="index.html#Kansas">Kansas</A> to participate in the dedication
of a monument just erected to the memory of the discoverer's of <A NAME="Pike.143" HREF="index.html#Pike">Pike</A>'s Peak,
and a young Captain, named S. D. <A NAME="Embick.144" HREF="index.html#Embick">Embick</A>, an assistant to the Chief of Artillery,
was sent out to accompany us on the trip. I was much attracted to him and
we rode along many miles together. He talked to me at length about the courses
at the Artillery School (where he had been an Instructor) and about the future
of the Coast Artillery.<P ALIGN=LEFT>At that time the Artillery Corps was composed of
Field Artillery units and Coast Artillery units, and an officer might be
detailed in either. Major General <A NAME="Arthur.150" HREF="index.html#Arthur">Arthur</A> <A NAME="Murray.150" HREF="index.html#Murray">Murray</A> had been made Chief of Artillery
and was pushing legislation to separate the Coast Artillery from the Field
Artillery. I had had a most interesting and profitable tour of duty for three
years with the Field Artillery, was a graduate of the school for Field Artillery
officers and, due to the training I had received from Captain Hinds, my prospects
for advancement in the Field Artillery were about as excellent as I could
have wished. At that time the average Field Artilleryman considered that
the Field Artillery should man all Horsedrawn artillery and that the Coast
Artillery should man all other artillery (of which there was practically
none in existence) -- and that never the twain should meet. The opportunities
for specializing, in the Coast Artillery, in work of an Electrical Engineering
character, as portrayed by Captain <A NAME="Embick.161" HREF="index.html#Embick">Embick</A>, greatly appealed to me and I decided
(against the recommendations of most of my friends), upon the separation
of the Field and Coast Artillery, to apply for transfer to the Coast Artillery
Corps, with preference for assignment to a newly organized Submarine Mine
company (where it would be necessary to install their new Casemate apparatus).<P ALIGN=LEFT>I
was eventually assigned to the Coast Artillery and received orders to proceed
to Fort <A NAME="Adams.167" HREF="index.html#Adams">Adams</A>, <A NAME="Rhode.167" HREF="index.html#Rhode">Rhode</A> Island, for assignment to the newly organized 129th
(Mine) Company.<P ALIGN=LEFT>All Artillery officers had received, some time before,
a copy of the Submarine Mine Manual. I recall that I took my copy on the
train with me (I had never previously looked in it) with the idea of studying
it while on route to Fort Adams. After I had gotten comfortably settled,
I took it out and read the first few pages, which seemed to be quite easily
understood. Then reference was made, without explanation, to Plate I, showing
the wiring diagram for the Power Panel, the Operating Boards and the other
Casemate apparatus. I examined it carefully. It consisted of a multitude
of lines, so involved that I couldn't trace any circuit in it. I began to
wonder if I hadn't made a mistake in transferring to the Coast Artillery.
I had never realized before how impracticable my course in Electricity had
been at <A NAME="West Point.179" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. I did not learn to read the diagram until I went to the
Coast Artillery School, about two years later.
