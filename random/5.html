5. The Country Doctor
</H3>
<HR> <P ALIGN=LEFT>
During the period of
two or three years that we remained at <A NAME="LaFayette.19" HREF="index.html#LaFayette">LaFayette</A> Springs there occurred a
severe outbreak, in the <A NAME="Tallapoosa.20" HREF="index.html#Tallapoosa">Tallapoosa</A> River valley, of what was then known as
Swamp Fever. In a short time it struck nearly every family around LaFayette
Springs, and almost invariably it resulted in death within a few days. Father
knew that the malady was really <A NAME="Hematuria.23" HREF="index.html#Hematuria">Hematuria</A>, a virulent type of malaria. He
had been taught at the Medical College that quinine was the only known specific
for malaria. In those days the only form of quinine available was the <A NAME="Sulphate.25" HREF="index.html#Sulphate">Sulphate</A>
of <A NAME="Quinine.26" HREF="index.html#Quinine">Quinine</A>, and he soon found that, as the result of the malady, the stomachs
of his patients were unable to assimilate the quinine, so that it was practically
ineffective. In a few days the number of cases and deaths became very large.
Father was the only graduate physician in the entire affected area, and,
in spite of all his efforts, continued night and day without rest, he was
forced to admit to himself that all of his medical knowledge and training
did not enable him to meet the heavy responsibilities that he felt devolved
upon him. So, in desperation, he sent a telegram to his Professor at the
Medical College and to the author (Dr. <A NAME="DeCosta.34" HREF="index.html#DeCosta">DeCosta</A>, I believe, Professor at the
<A NAME="Pennsylvania.35" HREF="index.html#Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</A> Medical College) of the standard textbook then in use, outlining
the situation, stating that <A NAME="Quinine.36" HREF="index.html#Quinine">Quinine</A> was entirely ineffective, and asking
them to wire him, at his expense, any suggestions that they could give him
for his guidance.<P ALIGN=LEFT>They both replied at once, in long telegrams, to the
effect that quinine was the only known specific for <A NAME="Hematuria.39" HREF="index.html#Hematuria">Hematuria</A>, and that if
it could not be given by the mouth possibly some result could be obtained
of application, such as rubbing it on the skin, etc. And it was typical of
their appreciation of the conditions that both telegrams came to him Prepaid.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Since
the alternative methods suggested offered no practical solution to his problem,
he had no other recourse except to depend upon his own resources. He felt
sure that, for quinine to be effective against any type of malaria it must,
in some way, get into the blood stream, and he determined to try the then
unheard of plan of converting the sulphate of quinine into an alcoholic extract
which could be administered hypodermically.<P ALIGN=LEFT>When he reached his office
he found four or five men waiting for him and begging him to come at once,
before it was too late, to see one or more members of their families who
had just come down with the fever. He called in one of these men -- a close
friend -- to his office and said to him, in effect, "There isn't any medical
treatment known to the highest medical authorities in the country that will
do these people any good. I have made up my mind, as a last resort, to try
to make up a preparation of <A NAME="Quinine.55" HREF="index.html#Quinine">Quinine</A> in liquid form which I can give hypodermically,
in the hope that it may prove effective. It will take me all night to do
this. I want you to stay out there; tell anyone that comes what I am doing,
and don't let anyone come in to bother me until I call you." He had good
training in pharmacology and by daylight he succeeded in making up about
8 ounces of the extract. He then called in his friend and said, "I have this
extract ready now. Before I give it to anyone else I am going to give it
to myself to find out what its effects will be, and I want you to be present
so that if things don't work out right you will know just what happened."
He then injected into his arm the equivalent of 40 grains of the <A NAME="Sulphate.64" HREF="index.html#Sulphate">Sulphate</A>
of <A NAME="Quinine.65" HREF="index.html#Quinine">Quinine</A>. Within a few minutes his ears began to ring. He was so excited
that he forgot all about having spent the preceding three or four days in
the saddle. He then repeated the hypodermic and in a short time he knew that
he was thoroughly cinchonized.<P ALIGN=LEFT>He mounted his horse and rode to the home
of his nearest patient, the daughter of one of his friends, another child
of whom had died a few days before. The patient was unconscious, with a high
fever, was hardly breathing and had hardly any pulse. He gave her a 40 grain
hypodermic. Within a few minutes she broke out in a profuse perspiration,
her breathing and pulse began to improve, and she recovered consciousness.
He waited half an hour and then gave her another hypodermic. Waiting only
long enough to see that she continued to improve, he said to her father,
"I must leave now. There are a dozen or more patients whose lives may depend
on my seeing them right away. I shall probably not be able to see your daughter
for several days, but I do not believe that it will be necessary for me to
do so. I have done everything I can do and I feel confident that she will
get well." (She did.) He then started on his round of patients, being able
to see most of them only once and getting no sleep for a day or two. Practically
all the patients he could see recovered.<P ALIGN=LEFT>While I suppose this might be
considered a satisfactory ending for this story, there is a subsequent chapter
that might possibly be of interest to you.<P ALIGN=LEFT>At the time of the wedding of
my father and mother they decided to use what little savings he had for setting
up their new home, and, if circumstances permitted, to postpone their wedding
trip until the next year when they might attend the <A NAME="Cotton.87" HREF="index.html#Cotton">Cotton</A> Exposition in
New <A NAME="Orleans.88" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A>. Things did work out so that they were able to take this trip,
and in due time they arrived in New Orleans. From the railroad station they
took a street car (horse drawn of course) to go to the hotel. Father happened
to sit down by a rather distinguished looking gentleman, with whom, as was
his wont, he soon engaged in conversation. In reply to a question father
had occasion to say that he was a physician from <A NAME="Mississippi.93" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A>. The man replied
that he was a physician himself, and, as is apparently the normal thing in
such cases, they began to talk shop (leaving grandmother to read the paper
presumably). The man said, "I suppose you must have had considerable experience
in the river bottoms with <A NAME="Hematuria.97" HREF="index.html#Hematuria">Hematuria</A>," whereupon father told him that he had
recently gone through quite an epidemic of it. Upon being asked what treatment
he had found most satisfactory he explained the details of the treatment
he had used. The physician was greatly interested and he informed father
that he was the head of one of the largest hospitals in New <A NAME="Orleans.101" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A>, that
there were several patients then in the hospital with Hematuria, and that
they did not respond to any treatment given them. He begged father to come
at once with him to the hospital, stating that his brother was a large manufacturing
druggist who could speedily make up the quinine extract in accordance with
father's procedure, and that he hoped that by speedy action father might
be able to save the lives of some of these patients. So they explained the
situation to the bride, father went with his (by this time) friend to the
hospital, and mother went on to the hotel, where she remained until father
joined her two days later. All of which I suppose might be considered a normal
wedding trip for a doctor's bride.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The concluding chapter of this incident
took place a year or so later. At a meeting of the State Medical Association,
in <A NAME="Oxford.113" HREF="index.html#Oxford">Oxford</A>, which father attended, the head of the New <A NAME="Orleans.113" HREF="index.html#Orleans">Orleans</A> Hospital had
been invited to read a paper on the subject of <A NAME="Hematuria.114" HREF="index.html#Hematuria">Hematuria</A>, as the result of
the unusual record of success in its treatment at that hospital. He prefaced
his talk with the statement that he was particularly pleased to be invited
to make it in <A NAME="Mississippi.117" HREF="index.html#Mississippi">Mississippi</A> in view of the fact that the treatment followed
in the hospital had been suggested to him by a young Dr. <A NAME="Gardner.118" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>, who was
a resident of Mississippi, and to whom he desired to give full credit for
the success that had been attained. Father always remembered his gracious
action with pleasure.
