We arrived at the old West Point Hotel (long since torn
down) on the afternoon of the day before I was to report. After an early
dinner we could hear, in the next room, a candidate with his tutor, who was
apparently giving him a final quiz on the subject of Geography. He asked
about a lot of obscure places I had never heard of, and I felt quite unprepared
in that subject. Father said, "You have nothing to worry about. Those are
all catch questions and do not afford a fair test of a candidates' knowledge
of Geography. You go to bed and get a good night's sleep. I am going down
stairs and smoke a cigar." I did and he did.<P ALIGN=LEFT>A professional looking man,
of about father's age, was sitting smoking in a chair next to father's. Of
course the two got into conversation. It developed that they were both doctors.
They got into the discussion of some interesting medical subject that lasted
almost until midnight. The stranger, near the end of the conversation, asked
father what he was doing at <A NAME="West Point.31" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. Father told him that he had brought
his son up to take the entrance examinations. The gentleman seemed to be
interested and asked him a number of questions, including one about my physical
condition. Father told him I was thin and somewhat run down as a result of
a year's hard work at the University and of a siege of malaria, but that
I was physically sound in every respect. At the close of the conversation,
the gentleman remarked casually, "I happen to be <A NAME="President.37" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Physical
Examining Board that meets here tomorrow. I'll doubtless have an opportunity
to see your son."<P ALIGN=LEFT>Next morning Father departed early for <A NAME="New York.39" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, leaving
me to report as a candidate. I walked from the Hotel across the plain toward
the Cadet barracks, with my suit case. I passed a portly, rather distinguished
looking man with a lot of striped on his arm. His air of importance impressed
me. I decided he was probably the Superintendent. With some hesitancy I ventured
to ask him where candidates were supposed to report. He condescended to tell
me. Within a few days I was able to identify him. He was the Provost Sergeant.<P ALIGN=LEFT>When
I went up for my physical examination, the young doctor who recorded, among
other things, my height and weight, made some notation on my Examination
Form. I noted that it recommended my rejection on the ground of my being
under weight. When the examination was completed I handed the completed Form
to a Colonel, Medical Corps, who (I did not know all this at the time) was
the <A NAME="President.51" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> of the Board. He glanced at the Form, saw the notation, then
looked me over quite carefully. He then sent for the officer who had made
the notation and said, "I know all about this young man and I am quite sure
that he is all right physically." I was certainly at a loss to understand
what he meant when he said that he knew all about me, and it was some years
later before father happened to tell me about his conversation on the porch
of the <A NAME="West Point.57" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> Hotel. I have no doubt but that for that conversation I
should have been rejected physically -- thus bringing to an end my hopes
for West Point.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The mental examination went off better than I had expected,
and I felt reasonably well satisfied that I had passed. Within a few days,
we (about 150 in all) were turned out in the area about 10 o'clock one morning
and formed in line. In a few minutes a distinguished looking officer ( the
Adjutant) wearing a full dress uniform and what I afterwards learned to be
aiguelettes (I have an idea that I may not have learned to spell them though),
took his place in our front, holding a formidable looking document in his
hands. After an effective pause he directed, "Those candidates whose names
I shall call report to me here as your names are called." The first name
he called was mine. I was astonished and scared. I afterwards learned that
some horses are afraid to leave the picket line alone. I was then able to
appreciate their feelings, for I had the same sort of feeling and I stood
motionless ( except perhaps for my knees) in place in ranks. The upper classmen
in charge began moving up and down the line, repeating my name impatiently.
Finally one of them spied me and, in a few doubtless appropriate words, directed
me to move out to the front. When I got up to the Adjutant he said, "Take
your place on my right, over there, facing the formation." I did so, and
I felt very much alone as I looked at the other 150 or more candidates in
ranks. I considered various possibilities. My conscience was perfectly clear
that I had not cheated in any way in the examinations and that I had not,
on any occasion deviated in the slightest degree from the truth. It appeared
to me that I was at least going to be made a horrible example of, and I may
have had a mental resolve that if they shot me I would meet my end bravely.
In a short time another name was called and another candidate took his place
beside me. My spirits rose rapidly. Whatever the trouble might be, it relieved
me greatly that there was another man who would bear me company. Eventually
a group was formed on each side of the Adjutant. Facing toward my group he
said, "You young gentlemen are all alternates. You have all passed the entrance
examinations. However your principals have also passed their entrance examinations
and they will be admitted as cadets." He also told us that, having passed
the entrance examinations, if we, in future, received an appointment as principal
or alternate we would be exempt from the entrance examinations. He concluded
by stating that the authorities would like for us all to be off the Post
by retreat that evening.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I afterwards figured it out that my name was called
first because the names were arranged by states, alphabetically, and <A NAME="Arkansas.94" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A>
headed the list of states.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The upper classmen in charge of the barracks
told us good by and said they hoped we would get another appointment and
return some day, and <A NAME="Joe.97" HREF="index.html#Joe">Joe</A> <A NAME="McAndrew.97" HREF="index.html#McAndrew">McAndrew</A> told me how sorry he was that we couldn't
both get in, and that he hoped I would be able to get another appointment.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Father
had stopped in <A NAME="New York.99" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> to see Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.99" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>, who was then one of the principal
officers of the <A NAME="Henry.100" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Hentz.100" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> & Co., 22 <A NAME="William.100" HREF="index.html#William">William</A> Street, and Mr. Skipwith had
very kindly invited me, in case I did not get in to <A NAME="West Point.101" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, to come down
to New York and spend a week with him before starting home. So I caught the
boat ( the old <A NAME="Mary.103" HREF="index.html#Mary">Mary</A> <A NAME="Powell.103" HREF="index.html#Powell">Powell</A>) for New York and we eventually arrived at some
pier there that afternoon. I got off the boat with my suitcase. The only
address I knew was 22 William Street. I had no idea where that was or where
I was myself. There were no taxis in those days, but a street car (horse
drawn) came down to the dock. I got on it and after making a number of transfers
I finally reached 22 <A NAME="William.108" HREF="index.html#William">William</A> Street, about dark. It was about 20 stories
high (the tallest building I had ever been in). There seemed to be no one
in it. Near the elevators was a huge display board listing the occupants
of the various floors, and I noted that <A NAME="Henry.111" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Hentz.111" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> was on the 17th floor.
I walked over to the elevators, one of which was running. By this elevator
there was a long glass tube, filled with red liquid, which moved up and down
with the elevator so as to tell where the elevator was at all times. This
indicator impressed me as being a very ingenious thing and I stood there
for some time trying to figure out how it worked. I regret that I have never
found out yet. I went up to the 17th floor. There was no one there except
a cleaning woman who was cleaning up the large offices there. I asked her
if she knew where Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.119" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> lived and she said she had no idea. <P ALIGN=LEFT>By
that time it was dark. I decided that I had better get to a hotel as soon
as possible. The only hotel of which I knew the name was the <A NAME="Astor.121" HREF="index.html#Astor">Astor</A> House
(not the present Hotel Astor), which was mentioned in Wm. <A NAME="Dean.122" HREF="index.html#Dean">Dean</A> <A NAME="Howell.122" HREF="index.html#Howell">Howell</A>'s "Our
Wedding Journey." Fortunately, it was on <A NAME="Broadway.123" HREF="index.html#Broadway">Broadway</A>, only about six blocks
away, so I carried my suitcase over there. I wasn't much impressed with it
as a hotel. In fact, it didn't sem to me to be as good a hotel as the new
<A NAME="Goldman.126" HREF="index.html#Goldman">Goldman</A> Hotel in Ft. <A NAME="Smith.126" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>. On reflection I decided that "Our Wedding Journey"
must have taken place considerably before I was born. However I got a room.
By this time I was quite hungry. I had in my inside pocket about $200 (new
cadets were required to make an initial deposit of about that amount), the
largest sum I had ever had in my possession, and I decided it might be dangerous
to carry it out on the street, particularly at night. So I took out %5.00
and after recalling to mind <A NAME="Poe.132" HREF="index.html#Poe">Poe</A>'s "The Purloined Letter" I hid the remainder
in the slop basin. (There was no running water in the room -- only a wash
stand and pitcher) and ventured out on <A NAME="Broadway.134" HREF="index.html#Broadway">Broadway</A>. I had read somewhere about
the wonderful steaks, with mushrooms, that could be gotten in <A NAME="New York.135" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, and
I made up my mind to look for one of them. I walked many blocks looking for
one of the fine restaurants that I knew must be there somewhere, and I finally
found a nice, clean and well lighted one. (The sign, in large white script,
carried the name Child's, which was one I had never heard of.) I studied
the menu, which was posted on the window. Under steaks there were listed
<A NAME="Porterhouse.141" HREF="index.html#Porterhouse">Porterhouse</A>, Sirloin, and Hamburger. I had never heard of a Hamburger steak
and I decided that it must be some kind of <A NAME="German.142" HREF="index.html#German">German</A> dish. As I had gained from
my reading the idea that German cooking was excellent, and as the price of
the Hamburger steak was considerably less than that of the others, I went
in and ordered a Hamburger steak and sat back visualizing its savory and
juicy tenderness. When the waitress brought me in what I could not but recognize
as an ordinary meat ball, I managed to eat it, but without any great enthusiasm
for German cooking.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Next morning I, with my suit case, was waiting in front
of 22 <A NAME="William.149" HREF="index.html#William">William</A> Street when Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.149" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> arrived. I spent about a week as his
guest. I spent the days in the <A NAME="Henry.150" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Hentz.150" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> Co. offices or on the floor of
the <A NAME="Cotton.151" HREF="index.html#Cotton">Cotton</A> Exchange, and in the evenings we always went to some place for
dinner, followed by a show. I saw more of <A NAME="New York.152" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> during that week than
I did in all of the five years that I spent at Ft. <A NAME="Totten.153" HREF="index.html#Totten">Totten</A> later on (Ft. Totten
is about 13 miles from New York). Mr. Skipwith seemed to be a welcome visitor
everywhere. I remember that he took me in to the offices of J. P. <A NAME="Morgan.155" HREF="index.html#Morgan">Morgan</A>
(on Wall Street, about a block away) on one occasion and everyone there seemed
to give him an especially cordial welcome. Mrs. <A NAME="Helen.157" HREF="index.html#Helen">Helen</A> <A NAME="Hunt.157" HREF="index.html#Hunt">Hunt</A> Close (I still
remember the name) was the telegraph operator on the private wire in the
office. She was a most charming lady, about fifty, with gray hair. Upon being
left a widow with but little income she had taken up telegraphy as a means
of livelihood and become an expert. She had a son about my age and she took
quite a motherly interest in me. I recall that she had me have my hair cut
and my shoes shined -- presumably so that I might, in so far as possible,
conform to the standards of dress and personal appearance that prevailed
in the offices of H. <A NAME="Hentz.165" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> & Co.<P ALIGN=LEFT>This firm was one of the oldest and largest
in <A NAME="New York.166" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>, of its kind. The members of the firm were very nice to me, and
they talked to me quite frequently. They seemed to be interested in my impressions
about New York -- everything about which was, of course, new and strange
to me. After a few days they began to ask me about my experience at West
Point, and they made me explain in detail just why I had not been admitted.
I told them that my principal having been admitted I could not also be admitted.
They asked me what had happened to the appointees of the other Senator from
<A NAME="Arkansas.173" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> (Senator <A NAME="Jones.173" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A>). After considerable thought I was able to recall
that he had not designated an alternate and that his principal had been among
those failing to pass the entrance examinations. They then asked me why,
inasmuch as I had already passed the examinations, I didn't get Senator Jones
to appoint me and go back and join the entering class. I told them that I
was sure that Senator Jones wouldn't give me the appointment, as my father
had no use for him and had told him so. They laughed at this and said, "I
am afraid you don't know much about politics. Your father has, as friends,
some of the most influential men in Fort <A NAME="Smith.181" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>, and if they urge Senator
<A NAME="Jones.182" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A> to give you the appointment he will without doubt do so, irrespective
of any personal feelings he may have about your father." Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.183" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> immediately
sent telegrams to about half a dozen or more of father's friends, explaining
the situation and asking them to urge Senator Jones to give me the appointment,
which they did.<P ALIGN=LEFT> Within a few days father, then at <A NAME="Johns.186" HREF="index.html#Johns">Johns</A> <A NAME="Hopkins.186" HREF="index.html#Hopkins">Hopkins</A>, received
a letter from Senator Jones, enclosing one from him to the Adjutant General
of the Army stating that if it was allowable under the rules of the War Department
he would like to transfer his appointment to me and have me join the entering
class.. He suggested to father that he personally present the letter to the
Adjutant General, as it was quite likely that he (the Adjutant General) would
be inclined to disapprove my appointment as being irregular. Father hastened
to <A NAME="Washington.193" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> and went to the War Department, found the office of the Adjutant
General, with a portly, gray haired darky messenger sitting outside the door.
He told the door keeper who he was and said he would like to see the Adjutant
General. The darky peeked through the door and told father to "go right in".
He entered a large, well lighted office and walked up to the large desk at
which sat Major General H. C. <A NAME="Corbin.198" HREF="index.html#Corbin">Corbin</A>, the Adjutant General, busily studying
a paper on his desk. Father stood there for some minutes but the Adjutant
General didn't even look up from his paper. Finally father's wrath rose to
the boiling point and, forgetting that his real mission was to ask the Adjutant
General to do him a favor, he proceeded to tell the Adjutant General that
he was not accustomed to being ignored in such a manner; that he had come
to see him at the suggestion of Senator <A NAME="Jones.204" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A> and that he considered that
he was entitled to being treated with at least common courtesy. General <A NAME="Corbin.205" HREF="index.html#Corbin">Corbin</A>
was, at that time, the most powerful officer in the War Department and also
he was a man of quite dictatorial manner. He looked up, apparently unaware
of father's presence. Father's rather unusual method of introducing himself
apparently appealed to him. He got up, shook hands, apologized for not having
noticed father's presence and inquired what he could do for him.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Father,
realizing that General Corbin had intended no discourtesy, apologized in
turn for his outburst and gave him Senator <A NAME="Jones.212" HREF="index.html#Jones">Jones</A>'s letter, together with
an explanation of the circumstances. General <A NAME="Corbin.213" HREF="index.html#Corbin">Corbin</A> read the letter, asked
father where I was at the time and said he saw no reason why I shouldn't
be given the appointment, and that he would telegraph me at once to return
to <A NAME="West Point.216" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. Eventually <A NAME="McAndrew.216" HREF="index.html#McAndrew">McAndrew</A>, my Principal, and I entered and graduated
in the same class. I do not know of a precedent. I feel quite certain that,
had I not met the keen minded officers of <A NAME="Henry.218" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Hentz.218" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> & Co., and had not
father made a distinct, and probably unusual, impression on the Adjutant
General, I should probably never have gone to West Point.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I recall one
incident while I was waiting in <A NAME="New York.221" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>. One morning I was standing in the
ticker room at the Hentz office when Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.222" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A> came into the room. He
ran some of the ticker tape through his fingers and, turning to me, said,
"Well, <A NAME="Fulton.224" HREF="index.html#Fulton">Fulton</A>, I just made $6000 while I was looking at this tape. Don't
you think that would justify us in going over to <A NAME="Delmonico.225" HREF="index.html#Delmonico">Delmonico</A>'s (the famous
old Delmonico's restaurant was just across the street) for lunch?" I assured
him that I did. When we entered the Dining Room the Head Waiter (I suppose
that at Delmonico's the title begins with capitals), who seemed to be a particular
friend of <A NAME="Skipwith.229" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>'s, sat us down at one of the best tables and began to
take our orders. The menu was in <A NAME="French.230" HREF="index.html#French">French</A> and I had no idea what most of the
dishes were. Skipwith gave his order. I studied the Menu for a while and
then, knowing that I could make no mistake, casually said that I would take
the same. The only items on the Menu that I recognized were the <A NAME="Cafe Noir.233" HREF="index.html#Cafe Noir">Cafe Noir</A>
and Cafe au Lait. Skipwith ordered Cafe Noir. Just to show the Head Waiter
that I too was quite familiar with French, I ordered Cafe au Lait instead.<P ALIGN=LEFT>While
we were waiting for our food I was sitting there deep in thought. <A NAME="Skipwith.236" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>
asked me what I was thinking about. I told him I was just wondering if he
made $6000 every day before lunch. He smiled and said, "I had an idea that
you had some such thought, and I am going to take this opportunity to give
you some advice. I have spent most of my life in the cotton business. I am
the head of <A NAME="Henry.241" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> <A NAME="Hentz.241" HREF="index.html#Hentz">Hentz</A> & Company's cotton department -- one of the biggest
in the <A NAME="United States.242" HREF="index.html#United States">United States</A>. I have a whole floor of experts -- college professors
and others, who devote their time to tabulating and studying all sorts of
statistics about cotton. I get a daily report from every county in the United
States that raises cotton, and I have been in most of them myself. I have
made about a dozen fortunes in my lifetime, and I have lost about thirteen
of them. If, with all the facilities that are at my disposal, and with a
life time study of the subject, I can't be sure which way the market is going
to jump, what chance do you think you, as a young Army officer, would ever
have of guessing right about it? So my advice to you is this: If you ever
have a little money ahead, and you feel that the excitement of gambling would
be worth the expenditure of this money, go ahead and play roulette, faro,
or, if you prefer, buy cotton. If, however, you ever happen to be in need
of a few hundred dollars, don't ever buy cotton in the hope of making it."
I am telling you this because I have always considered that this was expert
advice, and I have always followed it. I commend it to you.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Mr. <A NAME="Skipwith.256" HREF="index.html#Skipwith">Skipwith</A>
also told me at this time that he had made up his mind to sell his seat on
the <A NAME="Cotton.258" HREF="index.html#Cotton">Cotton</A> Exchange on the first day of the year, and to accept an offer
of $10000 a year (which was a good deal in those days) made by a large firm
of textile manufacturers in the North, to go to <A NAME="North Carolina.260" HREF="index.html#North Carolina">North Carolina</A> and supervise
the purchase of all their cotton, which was of especially high grades. He
said that he planned to buy himself a nice place where he could raise fine
stock as a pastime, and that he expected never to buy another bale of cotton
for himself. I never saw him again after I left <A NAME="New York.264" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A> a day or so later.
He carried out his plans in full and lived happily on his place (he was never
married) until his death some five years later. Upon the receipt of my telegram
from TAG I returned at once to <A NAME="West Point.267" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. I noted, not altogether with amusement,
that the upper classmen who had, with such friendliness, told me goodby a
couple of weeks ago seemed to take it in the nature of a personal affront
that I had come back again so soon. At any rate they gave me their personal
attention to assure that I might make up for the time lost.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I entered West
Point on August 6, 1900. The remainder of the Senatorial appointees had entered
on July 15th. My class, which really consisted of two classes in one, aggregated
about 180 on entering. We graduated 124, the largest number that had ever
been graduated in one class.<P ALIGN=LEFT>During the summer months the Corps of Cadets
went (and I suppose still goes) into camp, and is kept busy with practical
military training. In those days Plebe Camp was a rather strenuous experience,
as hazing was still an active institution. Most of the hazing was of a quite
harmless nature; some of it, conducted generally by a few bullies, was more
serious in character.<P ALIGN=LEFT>One of the harmless stunts was to give bunk privileges
(plebes were not allowed to sit or lie down on their bunks during the daytime)
for a week to the first plebe who, on a practice march, succeeded in finding
and bringing back to camp a small turtle. Then there would be held a Corps
review, the turtle being the Reviewing Officer and the plebes (in appropriate
costume) taking the place of the Adjutant, the Band and the Battalion and
Company commanders., and giving the proper commands at the proper times.
This ceremony was conducted with great solemnity and formality (on the part
of the plebes) and it actually served to teach the plebes the pertinent Drill
Regulations.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Each plebe was given a "Tee", which he was required to sound
off whenever asked his name. I suppose it has been a custom for perhaps nearly
a hundred years that, every year, some plebe from <A NAME="Arkansas.291" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> has had as his
"Tee" a portion of a speech alleged to have been made by a member of the
Arkansas state legislature when it was passing a law stating that the proper
pronunciation of the name of the state was <A NAME="Arkansaw.294" HREF="index.html#Arkansaw">Arkansaw</A> and not Arkansas. It
went like this: "Change the name of Arkansas!! --- Damn!! First raise the
bones of <A NAME="Thomas.296" HREF="index.html#Thomas">Thomas</A> <A NAME="Jefferson.296" HREF="index.html#Jefferson">Jefferson</A>! First make live the dust of <A NAME="Patrick.296" HREF="index.html#Patrick">Patrick</A> <A NAME="Henry.296" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A>! The
enormity of these crimes would no more compare with that of changing the
name of <A NAME="Arkansas.298" HREF="index.html#Arkansas">Arkansas</A> than does the pale glimmer from yon lightning bug's (posterior)
to the firey coruscations of the noon day sun in its flight!" I was required
to sound this off on every occasion con multo expressione and with many absurd
gestures.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Every few evenings P. D. Bunker, a yearling, (one of the greatest
football players and athletes in the history of <A NAME="West Point.302" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> -- who was, when
a Colonel, killed by the Japanese during or after the <A NAME="Bataan.303" HREF="index.html#Bataan">Bataan</A> Death <A NAME="March.303" HREF="index.html#March">March</A>)
would come into my tent and would say, "Mr. <A NAME="Dumguard.304" HREF="index.html#Dumguard">Dumguard</A>, I feel depressed. My
spirits are low. I crave music -- sweet, inspiring music. Suppose you attempt
to assuage my sadness by singing the laundry list backwards to the tune of
"<A NAME="Yankee.307" HREF="index.html#Yankee">Yankee</A> <A NAME="Doodle.307" HREF="index.html#Doodle">Doodle</A>." My rendition of this selection undoubtedly left much to
be desired as a musical treat. After a few off key efforts he would throw
up his hands, in apparent helplessness, to stop me, and would say, "Mr. Dumguard,
I am sure that your voice is not up to its usual standard. It seems to be
a little rough around the edges. I think that perhaps a dose of this would
improve it." and so saying he would pull a bottle of Tabasco sauce and a
spoon (to me it looked more like a ladle) out of his pocket and give me a
spoonful of "Hell Sauce". I really got to like the stuff, and I have always
retained my taste for it in soups, in oyster, crab or shrimp cocktails.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Speaking
of "Hell Sauce" reminds me of the Booze investigation, by a Congressional
committee during my plebe year.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Young Booze (actually his name) had been
appointed two years before from <A NAME="Pennsylvania.318" HREF="index.html#Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</A>. During his plebe year he resigned
and went home. HE died about a year later, and his family blamed his death
on the alleged fact that he had been forced to drink large amounts of Tabasco
sauce, as part of the hazing. Some newspapers and magazines took this up,
representing <A NAME="West Point.322" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> as the breeding place of a caste of cruel snobs,
and finally demanding that West Point be abolished entirely.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The facts
in the case were that, during Plebe Camp, Cadet Booze had shown a yellow
streak, as a result of which he had been cut (Not spoken to except on business)
by his own classmates as well as by the entire Corps. He was no longer hazed
in any way and, as a matter of fact, he probably took a negligible amount
of "Hell Sauce" as the papers called it. The popular clamor became so great
that a Congressional Committee conducted extensive hearings at <A NAME="West Point.329" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>
into hazing. As the result of this investigation the Corps of Cadets pledged
itself to discontinue all forms of hazing that involved physical hardships.
So far as I know this pledge has been carried out ever since.<P ALIGN=LEFT>One incident,
in connection with the Hearings, was of interest to me later. The Chairman,
a Congressman from the middle West, one day questioned the veracity and the
honor of a cadet who was testifying. Some of the spectators, from the Post,
hissed him and he ordered the galleries cleared. In his Report he bitterly
impugned the honor of the Corps of Cadets (entirely without justification).
A few years later his son received an appointment to <A NAME="West Point.338" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>. While a
cadet his father, while still a Congressman, was tried and convicted of fraud
of some kind and was sentenced to some years in the Penitentiary. This also
led to big headlines in the papers. I can imagine that the son bitterly regretted
his father's unfounded attack upon the honor of the Corps, during the Booze
investigation.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I recall with pleasure one incident that was perhaps representative
of a different type of hazing. In 1901, while I was a plebe, the Corps of
Cadets was sent to <A NAME="Washington.347" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> to participate in the Inauguration Parade of
<A NAME="President.348" HREF="index.html#President">President</A> <A NAME="Theodore.348" HREF="index.html#Theodore">Theodore</A> <A NAME="Roosevelt.348" HREF="index.html#Roosevelt">Roosevelt</A>. It was very cold when we left <A NAME="West Point.348" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, and
the uniform ordered was full dress coats, dress hats and overcoats. By the
time our train reached Washington it had turned quite warm. The present Union
Station had not then been built and we detrained some distance out of town
and marched for several hours, at the right shoulder arms, over to the residence
of the Secretary of War, in <A NAME="Georgetown.353" HREF="index.html#Georgetown">Georgetown</A>, where the tactical officers in charge
(mounted) were to go in for tea. With our heavy uniforms the long march was
a very exhausting one, and when the Corps was wheeled into line and halted
15 or 20 plebes (all in the rear flank) fainted and toppled over. My right
arm was so numb that I couldn't bring my rifle down to the Order, and I suppose
I looked pretty near all in, although I didn't faint. My front rank file
was <A NAME="Eddie.359" HREF="index.html#Eddie">Eddie</A> <A NAME="Farnsworth.359" HREF="index.html#Farnsworth">Farnsworth</A>, with Bunker, an All American football man, and later
Captain of the Football team. He was somewhat of a roughneck, of powerful
strength and physical endurance. He looked around at me and noted how exhausted
I looked. He studied a moment, and turning back to me said, "Mr. <A NAME="Dumguard.362" HREF="index.html#Dumguard">Dumguard</A>,
my cartridge box has been flopping up and down all the way over here, and
I am damned tired of having it do so. I don't know where we are going from
here but I want you to hold that box down securely every step of the way.
If I feel it flop once I'll give you hell. Do you understand?" This was his
way of telling me that he would carry the weight of my gun during the rest
of the march. He was turned back into my class at the end of the year and
I was very happy that I was able to give him some needed help in some of
his studies. I never saw him after we graduated, but while I was in command
of the <A NAME="Hawaii.371" HREF="index.html#Hawaii">Hawaii</A>an Separate Coast Artillery Brigade in Hawaii, years later,
his son, just graduated from <A NAME="West Point.372" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>, reported to me for his first assignment
and I told him about this incident. I noticed that, thereafter, whenever
we happened to meet, he seemed to be very kindly disposed toward me.<P ALIGN=LEFT>While
I was a plebe I was Gunner at the table in <A NAME="Schofield.375" HREF="index.html#Schofield">Schofield</A> Hall, the Dining Room.
(The plebe on my right was Milk Corporal and the one on my left was Water
Corporal). At the table there sat a 2nd classman, named <A NAME="Oscar.377" HREF="index.html#Oscar">Oscar</A> <A NAME="Foley.377" HREF="index.html#Foley">Foley</A>, who
had just come back from furlough in <A NAME="Missouri.378" HREF="index.html#Missouri">Missouri</A>. He was rather absent-minded,
and one of the yearlings teased him a good deal about being in love. Finally
the yearling told me to assume that the young lady in the case was named
<A NAME="Marie.381" HREF="index.html#Marie">Marie</A>, and to write a 150 line Ode to Marie. While I didn't exactly feel
that I owed Marie 150 lines, I finally was ready to read it. I recall only
the following lines:
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Oh, don't you remember, sweet Marie,<BR>
The night your pa set the dog on me?<BR>
And how, with one last, long lingering look<BR>
My flight to the trees I took<BR>
Where I stayed till the moon rose high<BR>
In the midst of the sky<BR>
And the stars came out o'erhead.<BR>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
I was required
to turn around toward the Mess Hall and recite this "Ode" many times. I introduced
some gestures that I thought appropriate. They seemed to like my gestures
more than my poetry; so thereafter another plebe was made to recite the "Ode"
while I did only the gestures.<P ALIGN=LEFT>My plebe year contained a number of surprises
for me. For instance, in Geometry class in High School we usually were given
two exercises a day to prepare. The first time I went to a Geometry class
as a plebe, the instructor handed me an open book of problems and said: "You
take these problems." When I went to the board I examined the book and, being
uncertain as to just which problems he meant, I asked him. I was quite surprised
when he replied, somewhat testily, "All of them." There were 17 problems
on the two pages. We also studied C. <A NAME="Smith.404" HREF="index.html#Smith">Smith</A>'s Algebra. I had, of course, studied
Algebra in the High School, but there was very little in C. Smith that read
anything like what I had previously understood to be Algebra. I recall having
to get up at 5 o'clock and go out to the sink (bath house), climb up a ladder
that rested under the only gas light in the room, and struggle to acquire
at least a speaking acquaintance with some of the weird things that C. Smith
had, somehow, dreamed up.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In my yearling year we had Descriptive Geometry
and Analytical Geometry. Fortunately for me they alternated daily. I never
succeeded in becoming initiated into the mysteries of Descriptive Geometry.
Fortunately, too, I had as instructor Captain R. E. <A NAME="Callan.413" HREF="index.html#Callan">Callan</A>, who was the best
instructor in Mathematics I ever had, and under him I found Analytical Geometry
to be very logical and interesting. I figured on making about a 2.0 (out
of 3.0) on the days we had Descrip and about 2.8 or 3.0 on the days we had
Analyt. We also had <A NAME="French.417" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>, and thanks to my High School French, I stood
in the first section.<P ALIGN=LEFT>In my second class year we had Chemistry, Electricity
and Mechanics, all of which I liked. When we were, at the beginning of the
year, first assigned to Sections (of not more than about 10 men each), it
was done on the basis of our standings in Math during the preceding year,
and I was assigned to the 6th Section in Chemistry and Electricity. We remained
in our original Sections for perhaps six weeks, when a General Transfer took
place, based on our marks during the six weeks. I was transferred to the
First Section. This was the first time I had been in the First Section in
anything except <A NAME="French.426" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>. The instructor, Capt. R. P. <A NAME="Davis.426" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A>, was a brilliant
officer, with a forceful and distinguished personality. He had apparently
decided on general principles that no cadet was good enough to be transferred
from the 6th Section to the 1st Section in one jump, and he had also apparently
decided to put me in my place.<P ALIGN=LEFT>We had about forty pages in <A NAME="Tillman.430" HREF="index.html#Tillman">Tillman</A>'s Chemistry
at a lesson. On the first day that I attended Captain Davis's Section, after
assigning to the other members of the Sections all of the subjects in the
day's lesson, he casually (apparently) handed me a card on which was written
the subject Carbon Monoxide, which had been in the lesson of some days before.
I had studied carefully the 40 pages in the lesson for the day, but I had
had no time to go back and review the preceding 40 pages. I went to the board
and studied the matter over. I couldn't remember enough about Carbon Monoxide
to make a recitation on it, so I hoped that I might be able to "bugle" (not
to be called upon before the blowing of the dismissal bugle). But Captain
<A NAME="Davis.440" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A> would see none of that, and after everyone else had recited (and I
felt I could have done as well) on the day's lesson he called upon me. I
turned about and said, "Sir, I am required to recite on Carbon Monoxide;
I do not remember enough about Carbon Monoxide to recite on it." With that,
while walking up and down in front of his desk, he devoted the rest of the
hour to telling me that he had felt quite sure, when I was transferred from
the 6th Section, that I did not belong in the 1st Section, and by now he
hoped that I fully realized that fact, etc., etc. This rather got under my
skin. When I got back to Barracks I decided that it would be a good idea
to go back and study Carbon Monoxide again. So, in addition to the regular
assignment of 40 pages for the next lesson, I carefully memorized the page
or two on Carbon Monoxide. When we went up for the next recitation, again
all the subjects in the day's lesson were assigned to other members of the
Section, and I thought maybe I was going to get a "stay-back". However, in
a few moments Captain <A NAME="Davis.454" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A> called me up to his desk and handed me a card.
I could see, from reading it upside down, that the subject was Carbon Monoxide.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>I immediately conceived a plan. Apparently without looking at the card,
I took my place at the last Board. I could see that Captain Davis was watching
to observe my reactions when I noted my subject. I very leisurely turned
up my card and read the subject. I then registered utter dismay, dire consternation,
and abject resignation to the inevitable, to the best of my ability (I was
later quite fond of amateur dramatics). Captain <A NAME="Davis.461" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A> hastened to hear all
the other members of the Section, and began walking up and down again, doubtless
preparing a master piece of ridicule for my edification and abasement. I
still did not face about to recite. The tension in the room began to rise
as everyone settled back to enjoy my discomfiture. I had written "Carbon
Monoxide" at the top of my Board, but had written nothing else on it. While
they were all watching me I wrote down C = 14 and 02 = 36 (the atomic weights),
and after looking at this notation for some time I took the eraser and carefully
and painstakingly erased the Board, first from top to bottom and then from
left to right. Somebody snickered. Then, registering abject embarrassment
and deep humiliation, I turned hesitantly about and said, "Sir, I am required
to discuss Carbon Monoxide." I then looked out the window, far off into space,
for perhaps a full minute. Some of the Section broke out into a half repressed
laugh. Then, without taking my eyes off the far space (but watching Captain
<A NAME="Davis.475" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A> with one eye) I began, very quietly and confidently, to repeat, word
for word, the text on "Carbon Monoxide". Captain Davis, as I fully realized
afterwards when I came to know him well, was a good sport. He instantly saw
what I had done, and I think he must have enjoyed it. At any rate, after
I had recited about two sentences he said, "That will do, Mr. <A NAME="Gardner.479" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>. You
may sit down." He gave me a 3.0 on the recitation. I believe I stood 5 or
6 in the subjects of Chemistry and Electricity, and Captain Davis was later
on one of my best friends. As Director, Department of Engineering, Coast
Artillery School, he was largely responsible for my standing one in my class
at the school and for my being sent to M.I.T., and later, as Senior Assistant
to the Chief of Coast Artillery, for my detail in that office, as an Assistant.
I never had occasion to refer to this incident in his presence, but I have
an idea that he had never forgotten it.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Fifty years later I had another
reaction in connection with this incident. In 1953, Brigadier General <A NAME="Robert.488" HREF="index.html#Robert">Robert</A>
F. <A NAME="Abernathy.489" HREF="index.html#Abernathy">Abernathy</A>, Retired, who lived in <A NAME="Summerton.489" HREF="index.html#Summerton">Summerton</A>, had occasion to drive to <A NAME="Charleston.489" HREF="index.html#Charleston">Charleston</A>
and, as he had done several times before, he stopped over in <A NAME="Summerville.490" HREF="index.html#Summerville">Summerville</A>
to see your grandmother and me.<P ALIGN=LEFT>He, also, had been an instructor of mine
at <A NAME="West Point.492" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> (bu I had forgotten that). I had served with him at Fort <A NAME="Monroe.492" HREF="index.html#Monroe">Monroe</A>
and I had been his Chief of Staff when he was in command of the H.S.C.A.B.
In some way the name of R. P. <A NAME="Davis.494" HREF="index.html#Davis">Davis</A> came up in our conversation and I recounted
this incident to him. He listened with much interest and then said, "I recall
very distinctly when you were transferred from the 6th Section to the 1st
Section. I was the Instructor of the 6th Section, and when the time for the
General Transfer came, RP (his friends all called him RP) came to me and
insisted that I must have given you too high marks. We had quite a heated
argument about it, but I insisted that you belonged in the 1st Section. I
watched your marks in that Section to assure myself that I had been right."
Considering that he had been an Instructor at <A NAME="West Point.502" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> for four years,
and bearing in mind the large number of cadets that had been in his Section
during that time, it was quite remarkable that he had remembered this incident
for more than 50 years, but had never before mentioned it to me. I am sorry
to have to add that about a week later I picked up the <A NAME="Charleston.506" HREF="index.html#Charleston">Charleston</A> paper and
read that General <A NAME="Abernathy.507" HREF="index.html#Abernathy">Abernathy</A> had died suddenly.<P ALIGN=LEFT>When I entered West Point
there had not been a cadet named <A NAME="Gardner.508" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A> for some years, and, as there was
no occasion for the use of my initials they were not generally known to the
upper Classmen. In the class following me however there was a C. H. Gardner,
and a <A NAME="John.511" HREF="index.html#John">John</A> <A NAME="deBarth.511" HREF="index.html#deBarth">deBarth</A> <A NAME="Walbach.511" HREF="index.html#Walbach">Walbach</A> Gardner. This was a slight inconvenience to me
as it made it necessary for me to remark all my laundry. However it resulted
in saving me from some 50 hours of walking punishment tours. It was the custom,
while we were in camp for the summer, for a big order to be made up of a
"boodle" (candy, cheese, cakes, etc.) from <A NAME="Charles.515" HREF="index.html#Charles">Charles</A> & Co. in <A NAME="New York.515" HREF="index.html#New York">New York</A>. This
was shipped to someone in Highland Falls (near <A NAME="West Point.516" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>). It was then brought
up, by row boat, to near the cadet camp (then near the Parade Ground)and
the cadets concerned slipped out across the sentinel line and brought their
respective purchases (all charged to them at Charles & Co.) into camp. One
night, in Yearling Camp, while about 15 or 20 of my classmates, including
me, were engaged in such an undertaking the authorities had a check roll
call made and we were all reported to the Officer of the Day as being absent
without authority. Next day the "skin list" was published, but to my great
surprise, unlike <A NAME="Abou.524" HREF="index.html#Abou">Abou</A> <A NAME="Ben.524" HREF="index.html#Ben">Ben</A> <A NAME="Adem.524" HREF="index.html#Adem">Adem</A>, my name was not included. Like <A NAME="Brer Rabbit.524" HREF="index.html#Brer Rabbit">Brer Rabbit</A>
I simply lay low and said nothing, expecting it to be included later. In
due time each of the other cadets concerned was awarded 25 (as I remember
it) punishment tours. Some time later I learned how my name had been omitted.
The Officer of the Day, upon receiving the reports as to the absentees, checked
their names against the Departure Book, upon which each cadet leaving camp
for an authorised purpose was required to register his name and time of departure
and return. When the name <A NAME="Gardner.531" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A> was called off to him by the Sergeant of
the Guard he asked "Which Gardner?" The Sergeant, happening to know my initials,
said "Oh, the one with all those initials." The O. D., checking the Departure
Book, noted that <A NAME="Gardiner.534" HREF="index.html#Gardiner">Gardiner</A>, J. deB. W. had registered out, and assuming that
that was my name he checked off my name as having been absent with authority.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I
recall one other experience that was, to me at least, interesting at the
time. Before we went on Furlough (at the end of Yearling Year) Happy <A NAME="Glassford.537" HREF="index.html#Glassford">Glassford</A>
(he died a few months ago), Runt <A NAME="Moody.538" HREF="index.html#Moody">Moody</A> and I (all class mates) decided it
would be a good idea to run a telegraph line to connect our rooms. So we
made our plans and, upon returning from Furlough each of us brought back
with him his proper share of the tools, wire, telegraph instruments, dry
batteries, etc. It was my job to run the wire, which was to be laid along
under the eaves under the attic roof. The only access to the attic was by
means of a trap door in the 7th Division, which was secured by a hasp and
a padlock. We pulled out the staple over which the hasp fitted so that I
could open the trap door and climb up into the attic. One of the others then
put the staple back in its holes so that the door appeared to be properly
locked. I had no flashlight and it was quite dark in the attic. Finally,
however, after having fallen, with my bag of tools, down several feet onto
the ceiling of Dialectic Hall (over the sally port), I reached the chimney
that was over my Division (the 3rd). It was a large one, about six feet square.
The problem was to locate that one of the eight flues that connected with
the fireplace in my room. I drilled a hole through the chimney wall and,
pushing through it a pencil shaped piece of lead attached at one end to a
large ball of twine, I began paying out the twine to find out what fireplace
was supplied by the flue in which I was. I payed out at least three hundred
feet of twine and still no bottom. Feeling quite sure that the Law of Gravitation
had not been repealed while I was on Furlough, and realizing that the barracks
building was not more than 75 feet high, I reluctantly was forced to the
conclusion that something was wrong somewhere, and I decided to investigate.
So, tying the string to a nail in the floor, I retraced my path to the trap
door, gave the prearranged signal, and, when my fellow conspirator withdrew
the staple again, I descended from the attic and went to my Division (the
3rd) to examine it, one room at a time, to see whether or if the string had
come out. After looking in three of the rooms on the first floor I went to
the fourth room. There was a plebe, sitting in the middle of the floor, pulling
in the string, which was piled up all around him. Upon my opining that I
would like to know what in the hell he thought he was doing, he gave the
possibly reasonable explanation that when the weight dropped down in his
fireplace he had assumed that, although he had no idea what its purpose was,
someone probably desired that he pull on the string, and he had sought to
do what he supposed was expected of him.<P ALIGN=LEFT>I returned to the attic, and after
boring three or four more holes, finally succeeded in getting the string,
and the wire, into my own fireplace. I then removed the dirt from the crack
between two of the floor boards, laid a piece of fine, silk covered wire
in the crack, replaced the dirt, running the wire to a point directly under
the leg of my table and fastening its end to a small brass tack driven into
the floor. The sounder, key, and dry battery were placed in the table drawer,
and a similar piece of wire was run through a hole bored in the table leg
down to another tack on the bottom of the table leg. The circuit, when in
use, was grounded by a short piece of wire which, when desired, could be
attached to the metal part of the gas light fixture over my table. I spent
many years later in Electrical work (at the Torpedo Depot) but I never again
got the thrill that I felt when, on making the final connection, the thing
worked perfectly. I appreciated how <A NAME="Cyrus.585" HREF="index.html#Cyrus">Cyrus</A> W. Field must have felt when the
first message was transmitted over the trans-<A NAME="Atlantic.586" HREF="index.html#Atlantic">Atlantic</A> cable.<P ALIGN=LEFT>For three
years, including the two years that we operated our telegraph line, the Tactical
Officer in charge of B Company (my Company) was Captain E. M. <A NAME="Blake.588" HREF="index.html#Blake">Blake</A> (known
to the cadets as The <A NAME="Buzzard.589" HREF="index.html#Buzzard">Buzzard</A> on account of his habit of sneaking up on us),
who prided himself that no cadet could put anything over on him. Early in
my plebe year, at one of his morning inspections, he found some dust under
the table in my room (I was Room Orderly at the time). He then proceeded
to tell me that it was quite apparent that I was not suited for the military
service and that I had better give up any such idea. This did not exactly
endear him to me, and throughout the three years that he was my Tac he and
I could hardly have been said to constitute a mutual admiration society.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Some
four years after graduation I was stationed at Fort <A NAME="Adams.597" HREF="index.html#Adams">Adams</A>, <A NAME="Rhode.597" HREF="index.html#Rhode">Rhode</A> Island,
and the then Major <A NAME="Blake.598" HREF="index.html#Blake">Blake</A> was in command of Fort <A NAME="Greble.598" HREF="index.html#Greble">Greble</A>, I was Ordnance Officer
and it was one of my duties to go out on the tug whenever there was target
practice. It was, and is, characteristic of <A NAME="Narragansett.600" HREF="index.html#Narragansett">Narragansett</A> Bay that often heavy
fogs exist until about mid day. Day after day the tug would lie off Beaver
Tail (one of the roughest places along the coast), rolling in the trough
of the sea, with all hands sea sick, waiting for the fog to lift enough for
us to be able to see flag signals from the Fort. There was living on the
Post a Mr. <A NAME="Garnett.605" HREF="index.html#Garnett">Garnett</A>, an Electrical Engineer employed by the Engineer Department,
with whom I became quite friendly. Radio was then just beginning to be talked
about and Mr. Garnett was much interested in it. We decided to assemble (with
some borrowed apparatus) a Radio installation on the tug and one on the shore,
to enable communication to be established between them during fog. We worked
practically continuously for several days and nights to get everything ready
for the next target practice. On the day before the practice the tug had
to make a trip to Ft. <A NAME="Greble.612" HREF="index.html#Greble">Greble</A>, and I went on it in order that we might be
able to test out our improvised Radio. As the tug pulled in to the dock at
Ft. Greble I saw Major <A NAME="Blake.614" HREF="index.html#Blake">Blake</A> leave his office at Headquarters and hurry down
to the dock.<P ALIGN=LEFT>The <A NAME="Buzzard.615" HREF="index.html#Buzzard">Buzzard</A> had observed the antenna that we had installed
on the tug and he was curious to see a radio installation. He came immediately
to the Chart House, where we had installed the radio. He opened the door
and saw me sitting at the table with a headset on. He was quite surprised
and just stood staring at me. After a while he said, "Mr. <A NAME="Gardner.619" HREF="index.html#Gardner">Gardner</A>, what are
you doing there?" I looked up and replied, "I'm telegraphing, Sir." He studied
a moment and then said: "They didn't teach telegraphy when you were a cadet,
did they?" Without interrupting my work, and without looking up at him I
replied: "No Sir; but I had a telegraph instrument in my room for two years
while I was a cadet." Doubtless he was thinking, as I was, that he had inspected
my room at least twice a day throughout that period, and the thought that
he had failed to discover the telegraph set undoubtedly disconcerted him.
He stood there for some time, swallowing his <A NAME="Adam.627" HREF="index.html#Adam">Adam</A>'s apple, and then, without
a word, quietly opened the door and slowly went back to his office. I cannot
truthfully say that I was entirely oblivious to his discomfiture.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Some
fifteen years later I learned that the policeman (Janitor) while scrubbing
the floor of my old room, had noticed a piece of the fine, silk covered magnet
wire that had become exposed in the crack between the floor boards, and had
reported it to the Commandant's office. I understood that this resulted in
quite an investigation, but that it was never discovered just where the wire
went. Bearing in mind the trouble that I had in getting the wire down the
chimney, I could appreciate the difficulties confronting such an investigation.<P ALIGN=LEFT>During
my four years at <A NAME="West Point.637" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A> I never achieved the exalted rank of even Acting
Corporal. With the exception of my Furlough I never had a leave of absence
of any kind, nor did I ever have occasion to visit in an officer's quarters.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Upon
graduating, on June 15, 1904, I had to make a choice of Arm of the Service.
My standing (21 in the class) gave me the choice of any Arm except the Engineers
(the first 10 could go in the Engineers). My fondness for horses (I had greatly
enjoyed the riding throughout the course) and the interest I had found in
the Light Artillery drills led me to choose the Field Artillery.<P ALIGN=LEFT>At that
time there were thirty Batteries of Field Artillery. They, with their stations
and their officers, were listed in the Army List and Directory (long since
discontinued). The first vacancy listed was in the 2nd Battery, with station
at Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.648" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>, <A NAME="Texas.648" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>, and I applied for, and received assignment to,
that Battery.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Upon graduating I received three months Graduation Leave,
which I spent at home.<P ALIGN=LEFT>During the time I was a cadet the Corps was sent
to two World's Fairs -- the Pan American Exposition, at <A NAME="Buffalo.651" HREF="index.html#Buffalo">Buffalo</A>, in 1902,
and the St. <A NAME="Louis.652" HREF="index.html#Louis">Louis</A> Exposition in St. Louis in 1904. While I was at home on
Graduation Leave I took my two brothers, <A NAME="Dan.653" HREF="index.html#Dan">Dan</A> and <A NAME="Drew.653" HREF="index.html#Drew">Drew</A>, to see the Exposition
in St. Louis. We spent about ten very interesting and very busy days there,
living in an inexpensive room near the grounds (and improvising a shower,
using a large tin can with a hole in the bottom, out behind the wood shed).
Before we left home, in conversation one day with Mr. <A NAME="Henry.657" HREF="index.html#Henry">Henry</A> C. Read, one
of our best friends, I happened to mention that we were going up to the Exposition.
He told me that, the year before, he had been in <A NAME="Cairo.659" HREF="index.html#Cairo">Cairo</A> and had met there
a Mr. <A NAME="Toby.660" HREF="index.html#Toby">Toby</A> <A NAME="Mohammed.660" HREF="index.html#Mohammed">Mohammed</A> (he showed me a beautiful scarab tie pin that Toby had
given him) with whom he had become well acquainted, and that he was now in
general charge of the <A NAME="Egyptian.662" HREF="index.html#Egyptian">Egyptian</A> exhibits at the Exposition. He said that he
thought it might be interesting to us to meet him, and he gave me a note
of introduction to him. One evening, shortly after our arrival, we were taking
in (or being taken in by) the "Streets of Cairo" and this reminded me of
Mr. Mohammed. I thought it might be a good idea to inquire of some one where
I might find him. I saw an "Algerian Soft Drink" stand. I seemed to recall
that <A NAME="French.668" HREF="index.html#French">French</A> was spoken in <A NAME="Algiers.668" HREF="index.html#Algiers">Algiers</A>. I had stood 6 or 7 in French and I thought
I was pretty good at it. I decided that if I went and spoke to the Algerian
in his native French he would perhaps take more interest in answering my
questions. So we went in to the booth. I saw two people behind the counter;
one a fat looking man at one end of the counter, and the other an equally
fat woman (doubtless some one's wife -- perhaps his). The man was engaged
in the perhaps profitable if not exactly esthetic operation of cleaning a
dirty glass with a dirtier towel. I approached him and said, in my best West
Point <A NAME="French.676" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>, "Pouvez vous me dire ou s'emploie <A NAME="Toby.676" HREF="index.html#Toby">Toby</A> <A NAME="Mohammed.676" HREF="index.html#Mohammed">Mohammed</A>?" He blinked
his eyes and said, "Huh?" I repeated my question very slowly and very carefully.
He motioned the woman to come closer. They looked at me and at one another
inquiringly. I repeated my question again loudly and distinctly. By this
time several innocent bystanders, hearing the noise, had come in to see what
the noise was all about. I repeated my question again. The man studied a
moment and a look of almost human intelligence spread across his face. It
reminded me of the sun breaking through the clouds after a rain. I thought
to myself, "At last, this is the triumph of mind over matter." He then said,
"I no spik ze Englis; I spik se <A NAME="French.685" HREF="index.html#French">French</A>." I backed, not necessarily gracefully,
out of the booth. I lost all interest in <A NAME="Toby.686" HREF="index.html#Toby">Toby</A> <A NAME="Mohammed.686" HREF="index.html#Mohammed">Mohammed</A>. I do not recall that
I ever undertook afterwards to speak to a Frenchman in his native language.
I rather felt that it was too bad that they had not had the advantage of
learning French at <A NAME="West Point.689" HREF="index.html#West Point">West Point</A>.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Upon the expiration of my Graduation Leave
I went in to the railroad station and asked for a ticket to Fort Sam <A NAME="Houston.690" HREF="index.html#Houston">Houston</A>,
<A NAME="Texas.691" HREF="index.html#Texas">Texas</A>. I had assumed, for some reason, that Fort <A NAME="Sam Houston.691" HREF="index.html#Sam Houston">Sam Houston</A> was at Houston,
Texas, and I did not learn, until the Ticket Agent told me, that it was at
<A NAME="San Antonio.693" HREF="index.html#San Antonio">San Antonio</A>, Texas.
