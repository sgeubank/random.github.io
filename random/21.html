21. DETAIL ON GENERAL STAFF, IN WASHINGTON

</H3>
<HR align=left>


<P>
During the first week in October I received another telegram, stating that
I had been detailed on the General Staff, and directing that I proceed without
delay to <A NAME="Washington.24" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>. I left the next day. I had no time to do anything about
packing our household effects, and this arduous task devolved upon my bride
of six months.

<P>
She instructed me to get an apartment having a southern exposure, in an apartment
house having an elevator and a dining room.

<P>
When I reached <A NAME="Washington.33" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A> I spent all my spare time looking for an apartment.
I was unable to find any kind of an apartment at any price. Eventually I
succeeded in getting a lease on a small apartment, sight unseen, in an apartment
house on <A NAME="California.36" HREF="index.html#California">California</A> Street, then under construction and not to be completed
for several months. It had a northern exposure, no elevator and no dining
room, but I considered myself very lucky when my bride arrived and we were
able to move in. We were able later to get a small, but better, apartment
at the <A NAME="Farnsboro.40" HREF="index.html#Farnsboro">Farnsboro</A>, on <A NAME="Florida.40" HREF="index.html#Florida">Florida</A> Avenue, where we lived for about four years.
During most of this time the Bishops also had an apartment there.

<P>
It is difficult to visualize the utter confusion that existed in the War
Department at this time. On the outbreak of the war General <A NAME="Scott.45" HREF="index.html#Scott">Scott</A> was Chief
of Staff and General <A NAME="Bliss.46" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A> was Assistant Chief of Staff.

<P>
General Scott was a fine, old, inarticulate, <A NAME="Indian.49" HREF="index.html#Indian">Indian</A> fighter (the greatest
authority in the country on Indian sign language), but he had little qualification
for Chief of Staff. General Bliss was a man of integrity and force, was a
scholar (a speaker of Russian and an eminent Ballistician); he had a slow,
but accurate and profound mind, excellent judgement and a great capacity
for details. He could doubtless have written a better paper on any subject
than any officer in the War Department, but he made the great mistake of
trying to handle personally, or to pass upon, revise or rewrite each of the
hundreds of papers a day that flooded through his office at this time. He
had few gifts as an Executive and an Organizer.

<P>
Under the restrictions imposed by the National Defense Act of 1916, there
were, on the declaration of war, but 19 officers on the War Department General
Staff (At the signing of the <A NAME="Armistice.63" HREF="index.html#Armistice">Armistice</A> there were more than 1200 officers
on or with the War Department General Staff.) By the time I arrived in <A NAME="Washington.64" HREF="index.html#Washington">Washington</A>
most of the 19 had been promoted and had been replaced by new and totally
untrained officers. With the exception of three or four these were assigned
to the War College Division and were organized into three or four committees,
to one of which I was assigned.

<P>
General <A NAME="Scott.71" HREF="index.html#Scott">Scott</A> had retired in September, 1917; General <A NAME="Bliss.71" HREF="index.html#Bliss">Bliss</A>, who succeeded
him, had been sent overseas on a mission to <A NAME="Russia.72" HREF="index.html#Russia">Russia</A> and thence to duty as
American Representative on the Supreme War Council at <A NAME="Paris.73" HREF="index.html#Paris">Paris</A>; and General
<A NAME="John.74" HREF="index.html#John">John</A> <A NAME="Biddle.74" HREF="index.html#Biddle">Biddle</A> (an Engineer officer, and a former Superintendant of the U.S.M.A)
a polished and educated gentleman but devoid of qualifications for Chief
of Staff, was Acting Chief of Staff. The General Staff had practically no
personnel or organization. No funds were available, and no program existed,
nor were any ships to speak of available. There was no one to decide upon
policies or to exercise control over the War Department. <A NAME="Benedict.79" HREF="index.html#Benedict">Benedict</A> <A NAME="Crowell.79" HREF="index.html#Crowell">Crowell</A>,
an Assistant Secretary of War, had gradually taken over most of such control
as was exercised and the duties of the War College Division (the only Division
that existed) consisted chiefly in passing on a multitude of relatively unimportant
papers and of such other ones as Mr. Crowell did not care to handle.

<P>
The Chief of Staff seemed to be merely a figurehead, occupied chiefly with
routine matters. No coordination existed over mobilization, training, transportation,
procurement, or shipping.

<P>
It was into such a scene of frustration and chaos that, in October, 1917,
I entered upon my duties as a General Staff officer.

<P>
Within a few months I was made Executive Officer of the War College Division,
and I was then even better able to appreciate the situation.
